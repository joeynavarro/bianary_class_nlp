history,2020-08-21 01:56:26,A brief overview of Poland saving the world ,idkwjv,6,4,I m American and have no Polish ancestry at all  but I have an affinity for Poland that s only become stronger over the years  I was finally able to visit Poland in 2019 and it was really fantastic  Many people are unaware just how much Europe and America owe to the scrappy  noble Pollacks  Recently I learned that  for centuries  some Poles have considered Poland to be the  Christ of Nations   That is to say  a benevolent nation continually exploited and betrayed  yet  which always rises again and in doing so brings salvation to others  It s a little sappy but  given the Poles  history  it s not hard to see how such an identity developed    I recently posted this as an answer to another user s question  but I think it merits its own post  Here is a brief list of all the times Poland really has saved others     1683  The city of Vienna  Austria  is under prolonged siege by the Ottoman Empire  The Turks are right on the cusp of breaching the exhausted city s defenses when  suddenly  a relief force arrives  The force  a coalition of Christian armies led by the Polish king Jan Sobieski and his famed  winged hussar  cavalry  routs the powerful Ottoman army  saving Vienna and marking a permanent end to years of Ottoman encroachment into Europe   Result    Poles save Europe and  arguably   Western civilization  itself       1770 s  Two Polish officers  a cavalryman named Casimir Pulaski and a combat engineer named Thaddeus Kosciusko  travel to America to lend their expertise to Washington s Continental Army  Pulaski literally saves Washington from certain death or capture when the general is nearly encircled at the Battle of Brandywine  Pulaski literally wrote the book on cavalry for the US military  earning the title  farther of the American cavalry  before being killed in battle in Savannah  GA  Kosciusko s engineering expertise was crucial to the American victory at the Battle of Saratoga  which finally turned the tide of war in favor of the Americans  Kosciusko also made possible the successful American retreat from Fort Ticonderoga  during which he laid obstacles along the retreat route that prevented the British from finishing them off    Result    Two Poles literally save America  It s fair to say that the American Revolution would likely have been lost without both of these Pollack badasses       1920  Poland is finally reestablished as an independent nation again in the aftermath of WW1   just in time for the newly founded Soviet Union to come knocking  The Bolsheviks  intoxicated by their successful 1917 revolution in Russia  intend to crush Poland so they can march into Germany and beyond  The Polish Army takes a beating at first but eventually turns disaster into victory  defeating the Red Army and thwarting Lenin s plan to bring communism to the rest of Europe    Result    Poles save Europe  Again       1939  The Poles are the first to break Germany s  Enigma  military code and are able to send invaluable cryptological resources and intel to Britain just before being overrun by the Wehrmacht  This was invaluable to Britain s enormously successful codebreaking operation based at Bletchley Park  The cracking of Enigma was a  huge  advantage to the Allied war against Germany  a frustrated General Rommel  unaware that Engima had been compromised  once complained that the Allies were seemingly  reading his mind     Result    The Poles play a major role in saving the world from Hitler       1940  Polish pilots fight in the sky alongside British pilots in the Battle of Britain  a victory that prevented Hitler s planned invasion of the UK    Result    This one is more of an honorable mention  since the Polish pilots probably weren t decisive in the victory  However  round the clock German attacks whittled Britain s fighter capability dangerously low  so every pilot in the sky mattered       1980 s  Non violent labor union activism throughout Poland proves to be a decisive political and symbolic defeat for communism  Moscow s inability to suppress the masses of patriotic Polish workers hastens the collapse of the entire Soviet bloc    Result    Poles peacefully inflict one of communism s most stinging defeats  Eat your heart out  Gandhi       21st century  TBD,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/idkwjv/a_brief_overview_of_poland_saving_the_world/

history,2020-08-17 06:31:13,Geiseric the Vandal King vs Attila the Hun  who would you choose as the better leader ,ib6n4w,0,2,For the record  i don t know much about Attila and know more about Geiseric  and i made this post to actually know more about both and feed my curiosity on who s the better between the two Scourges of Rome   I m a huge fan of Geiseric and his brilliant thinking of knowing where to hit Rome where it would hurt the most in a few attacks  But considering they came from Germania region  i think it gave them the advantage of knowing more about the Romans compared to Attila  And the fact that the Romans wouldn t expect the Vandals to march 1 500 miles just to attack them at their vital point and surprise them is kinda really more of a tactical brilliance than zeal  Although it ll take a very gutsy leader like Geiseric to force his people to march like that   Also one fact to consider is that  Geiseric has already brought major damage in Rome conquering one of Rome s major economic producer  Africa and Geiseric has the most north of it before Attila and the Huns became a major threat to the Romans   My question about Geiseric is  was he a good battle general  Did he produce superior army compared to Attila s   But in terms of Attila  killing his own brother was one considered as a political will advantage    Attila the Hun on the other hand  was deemed menacing because of his fast mobile troops and his superior army bows  which took the advantage against the Roman melee troops   But in historical accounts  during Attila s time  they more of a bow and foot soldiers rather than the horseback dominant forces  which i think they were known of years after Attila died   Thing is  the Romans were mostly aware of the Huns  fast moving and threatening army even far away from the East compared to Geiseric who took them by surprise and conquered North Africa  which possibly the only time they took Geiseric seriously    So comparing both cases  i d say Geiseric is more of a political tactician rather than the zealot invader Attila is  And considering Geiseric left most Christian Churches untapped while he s sacking the Roman empire  i think Attila gained the hand over him on being more brutal who sacked most of Roman territories and left it in brutal remains   But one advantage i think Attila has is his terrifying troops that the Roman has to send a ton of golds and negotiators just to leave them alone  Although one time  Aetius made Attila back out on a bluff  But for the record  Geiseric was deemed undefeated by the Romans and Attila only once   So the question remains  who is the better and more terrifying leader from the two  Or are the two almost equally good to be the scourges of Rome     x200B ,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/ib6n4w/geiseric_the_vandal_king_vs_attila_the_hun_who/

history,2020-08-11 09:22:14,The birth of modern Chinese nationalism,i7mle7,17,1,The Chinese nation   中華民族   is relatively a modern creation  It is the official ideology of the CCP  In this light  the Han and a myriad of different ethnicities form a greater family called the  Chinese Nation  Zhonghua Minzhu    According to this perspective  all previous dynasties were  Chinese  and all of them were upholders of the  Chinese civilization   However  that was not the case    To modern Chinese revolutionaries  Chinese civilization meant Han civilization  and Chinese nation meant the nation of Han  They wanted to create a Han based nation state and other nations had to be absorbed  In fact  this is nothing of extraordinary  France became France only after the revolution of 1789  Breton and Occitan were suppressed to make one greater nation called France  The same is true for China    During the Xinhai revolution  1911   the revolutionaries sought to overthrow the Qing dysnasty not only because they wanted to create a republican government but because they wanted to expel an alien and foreign rule  They considered the Manchus as oppressive alien barbarians  As Sun yat sen  the father of the revolution  has remarked     the Tartars  Manchus  must be expelled  and China Zhonghua  must be restored       Such hostility against the Manchus was not a recent phenomenon  The white lotus revolt of the 18th century was also an anti Manchu movement  Many Han Chinese collaborated with the English during the Opium war  The English were well aware of such ethnic divisions  The word Hanjian which came to mean  traitor  was not coined during to Sino Japanese war but during the Opium war  This is how the Manchus explicitly warned other Han Chinese    Another important ideologue of the revolution  Zhang Binglin  1869 1936  went even further      The Manchus are from a Tungusic tribe which differs from the Xiongnu  They are different from us in language  religion  food  and shelter  It cannot be said that they belong to the same race of ours  Today we live in an era of nationalism and therefore the Han and Manchus cannot be merged into one  Faulty seed must be selected out from the healthy seed  We have to wipe out the dirt from our house to build and preserve our Zhonghua    As from the quote  what Zhang Binglin wanted to create was a strong nation state which gave exclusive prerogatives only to the Han  In fact  he was even open to the question of Tibetan or Uighur independence  He was ready to accept their independence as long as they maintained friendly relations with the new Chinese republic    Now let s move on to what Sun Yat sen remarked himself      The Manchu government is not Chinese government  Today  the Chinese do not have their own government  Therefore  if foreigners call the government of Qing as China  then that is wrong  The Manchus originated from the Amur river  They periodically ravaged and pillaged Chinese cities  When the Ming was in decline with internal strife  they took the opportunity and marched south just like the Germanic tribes which invaded the Roman empire  This happened in 1644  The Chinese were brave and fierce and opposed alien rule  However  the Manchu barbarians massacred hundreds of thousands of our kinsmen       Now we are going to take our revenge  We are going to fly our banners high and each of us will pick up a sword  Let us take our revenge on those despicable Manchus and restore our fatherland   Nevertheless  what is interesting is that despite such heated rhetoric  Sun Yat sen came to moderate his views to practical ends  He was not a hardcore nationalist devoid of geopolitical perspective  He knew that he needed other nations if the Han were to be protected from Western incursions  Thus  he gave another important speech      The Tibetans are 5 million  the Mongols less than 1 million  and the Manchus a few million  The Hui are many but they are mostly Han by ethnicity  In view of geography  the Manchus are under Japanese influence  the Mongols under the Russians and the Tibetans under the British  They lack the power to counter foreign influence  Therefore  it is our duty to provide assistance  The Han are over 400 million and we need to make a complete  powerful and independent state  Our party  the Chinese nationalist party aka Kuomintang  must achieve a nationalist goal and to that end we need to assimilate the Manchus  the Mongols  the Tibetans  and the Hui to our Han nation   We need to build a greater nationalist state  Then the Han  together with these other nations will emerge as one greater nation of Zhonghua    As seen from the quote above  the  Chinese nation  was a geopolitical creation to counter other foreign influences  China s revolutionaries wanted to defend themselves from the Japanese  the Russians and the British by absorbing other nations in the periphery  Such a thinking was not the creation of the CCP but of the KMT  But the trend continued under the CCP since they were first and foremost nationalists rather than communists  Therefore  any criticism of the CCP for its handling of Xinjiang or Tibet is a tremendous threat to China s integrity as a state   Source   Japanese  Yokoyama Hiroaki   Chinese rule of foreign nations   橫山宏章  中國の異民族支配  2009

history,2020-08-08 21:06:23,On Manichean Eschatology and Cosmology,i63pah,2,14,Manicheanism posited that prior to the creation of the physical Universe  two eternal and primordial principles  Light Order Good and Darkness Chaos Evil  existed  each self contained  however  there occurred an attempt by the Darkness to  invade  the realm of Light  the familiar  pleroma   for those familiar with Gnostic works   and which ended with the Darkness  consuming  particles of light in an attempt to gain some of the attributes not inherent to it   This eventually resulted in the creation of the physical world  which  per Manichean doctrine  is itself a step in a somewhat convoluted plot for the realm of Light to eventually reclaim all the  light  which was taken from it during that first assault by the Darkness  Remember  that per Manicheanism  human souls were themselves captive particles originating from the light  and who longed a return to the  pleroma   this is how the religion explained the Problem of Suffering    My confusion regarding the religion arises because Manicheanism taught that at the end of time  the realm of Light would gather to it all the light that had been taken from it in that primordial struggle  and Light and Darkness would become separate once again  However  my question is  did the Manichean religion ever address the idea that the Darkness would once again invade the realm of Light eventually and initiate that painful process of creation anew   Their eschatology seems to never address this possibility  simply stating that the Light will eventually be  triumphant   a statement which makes no sense in a dualist religion anyways  smh  over the Darkness  and the two Principles will go back to being separate  The Darkness won t cease existing  though  since it is an eternal  fundamental aspect of the Universe itself  Which does make one wonder  what is to keep history from repeating itself   Given this  I also have to ask  was the Manichean conception of time cyclical  or linear   I understand that our understanding of Manicheanism is limited  despite insincere attempts by Gnostic revivalists to emulate the belief system  Little of their primary documents have been found  and we mainly rely on Uighur documents and accounts from non Manichees   Asking because I m heavily interested in the topic of this once widespread religion  as well as Gnostic movements in general  If anyone can lead me to any documents or sources or post what they themselves have read  or simply discuss the issue  that would be welcome   No  I m not an actual Manichean or believer in it  or in any other religion   The interest is academic  if that wasn t clear enough,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/i63pah/on_manichean_eschatology_and_cosmology/

history,2020-08-08 06:05:11,Could the Communists have taken over Germany ,i5rtuq,0,7,As a brainwashed Trotskyist I always believed in the narrative of the German Revolution which said that there were plenty of  missed opportunities  for the communists to seize power which would have come off if only there had been the  correct  leadership  In particular we complained that if Rosa Luxemburg had created a  Bolshevik style organisation  years in advance  with the centralism and discipline necessary  it would have triumphed instead of the disorganised Spartacist revolts that did happen  I have become sceptical of this based on what I have read  Firstly  the assumption is made that Luxemburg and her colleagues could have created a new organisation simply through strength of will  despite the dominance of the SPD over the working class  Secondly  Alexander Rabinowitch and others have suggested that the Bolsheviks were far from the centralised  disciplined organisation of Bolshevik myth  In organisation they were actually closer to the Spartacists than the organisation they would turn into in the midst of the civil war and the building of the new state  So blaming everything on poor leadership and a lack of organisation seems quite unfair to me   Moreover  German soldiers and workers remained solidly loyal to the SPD whereas in Russia they overwhelmingly came over to the Bolsheviks  The 1918 1919 revolution failed precisely for this reason  I am not convinced that there is anything that could have been done differently by the communist left in Germany to win over the largely pro Weimar army and Freikorps  If there is  I d like to know   Then there was the disastrous March Action of 1921  which nearly destroyed the KPD  This hardly deserves mention   Then there is the 1923 uprising  which was aborted as it was clear that the KPD did not have enough support  Trotsky  in Lessons of October  blamed everything on his colleagues such as Zinoviev and the KPD leader Brandler  complaining that they had not prepared well enough or done enough to convince the workers of their case  allowing the opportunity to slip away  Yet others have pointed out that Trotsky distorted the history by ignoring the objective conditions that the KPD faced   the deep rooted unwillingness of most workers to launch a revolution  the fact that Germany was not Russia in 1917  etc   Is there any way the Communists could have seized power in Germany  and if they somehow had managed to do so  could they really have held it,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/i5rtuq/could_the_communists_have_taken_over_germany/

history,2020-08-07 00:46:08, Serious  Zeitgeist of the U S  circa 1904,i50zo8,8,3,Hello r history   This is my first post in this subreddit  Glad to be with all of you   Back when I was doing my undergraduate degree in history  I took a course called  History and Film   Various events in  mostly  U S  history were examined through the lens of a Hollywood film about that event  When we were covering the Great Depression  we watched  The Grapes of Wrath   starring Henry Fonda  For those who don t know  the film is based on a novel by John Steinbeck  and it s about a family from Oklahoma  the Joads  who pack up and leave their farm for California due to the Dust Bowl   There s a scene from that movie that has stuck with me until today  When the family is packing up  Ma Joad finds a small porcelain figurine of a dog  She turns it over and the inscription reads    Souvenir of    Louisiana Purchase Exposition    St  Louis 1904   She smiles  I think  and puts it in her pocket  clearly intending to take it along with her to California  This leads me to my question   The Great Depression was obviously a not so fun time in American history  There was a lot of hardship and hunger  Conversely  the memories that little figurine gave Ma Joad about the 1904 St  Louis World s Fair were clearly positive   What was the zeitgeist in America around the time the 1904 World s Fair took place  Was the country brimming with confidence and full of energy  Was the economy humming  Did the president at the time  Teddy Roosevelt  lend the country a certain pizzazz  Why do you think Ma Joad would ve regarded that time period with such nostalgia  especially compared with the 1930s  I know  I know  the Depression era makes pretty much any other era look like a Golden Age   Was it regarded as a Golden Age only in retrospect  much as Europeans regarded the Belle Epoque  a time of peace and happiness before the brutal Great War   I know things in the U S  circa 1904 weren t hunky dory for everyone  This was the nadir of race relations in the U S   with Jim Crow laws being established and lynchings extremely prevalent  particularly in the South  Women did not yet have the right to vote  It was far from a perfect age  without a doubt  However  that scene made me wonder what the  spirit of the times  was in America around that particular time  and how it presented a contrast with Depression era America that made it seem so positive in the eyes of people like Ma Joad   What do you think  Thanks for replying,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/i50zo8/serious_zeitgeist_of_the_us_circa_1904/

history,2020-07-30 23:17:35,Soviet Speznas units  their training  psychological tests and such,i0tbmr,4,1,Hello      I have a rather unusual question  I hope this is the right sub for this question  I m sorry if not   Today something came to mind that I would finally like to come to terms with   My father was born in the soviet union and after university he had to go to the military  Because of seemingly exceptional capabilities he was put into a speznas unit  unfortunately I don t know which one specifically  I do know though that they were about 30 people stationed in Georgia near the border to Turkey in the mid late 80 s with the objective to storm and secure the nearest nuclear missile base in case the cold war turned hot   But while my father never faced combat  a conversation my sister had with him suggests he may have killed somebody in his life  Now this could of course either have been after his time in the military or not true at all  But she asked him directly if he ever killed somebody and he answered   Let s not talk about this   which kinda doesn t seem like an answer a person would give that never killed anybody   So the most logical scenario that I can think of in which he might have killed someone during his time in the red army would be something like a psychological test or training to ensure that the soldier in question is obedient and will kill on command  no questions asked   Seeing that many soldiers in wars shoot without proper aiming because deep down most humans don t want to harm or especially kill other human beings  this must be surely known to people in charge of training soldiers  especially those in special forces  And given the objective of securing a nuclear missile base to prevent nuclear weapons being fired all over the USSR it seems like a pretty big deal to me  not that I have any military training or knowledge myself  mind you   But it seems logical that if this is what you re there for  if this is what you train for  then there is absolutely no room for error or hesitation  Hence I can imagine that there could ve been some kind of psychological test or something that ensures the soldier will indeed kill without hesitation Some kind of training which ensures absolute obedience and proves the soldier will definetly do  whatever it takes  or rather whatever he is told to do   even if it involves killing an unarmed human   Now this implicates the execution of a most likely unarmed and defenseless person  because as I stated  he wasn t deployed to combat  Killing another soldier in war is of course also bad  but definetly something else than the scenario I described  I don t like my father either way  but somehow I can t find peace with this shit  because I know my father is definetly capable of killing someone  and also willing to under the right circumstances   Does anybody of you happen to know specifics of the soviet speznas units and their training  especially regarding such methods  Or do you know of similar methods in other armies special forces paramilitaries  etc  Do such psychological tests even exist or am I phantasizing about something that s not even a thing  But given that some gangs have things like killing someone as some kind of initiation ritual  it doesn t seem too far fetched to me that something of that sort could also exist in militaries  especially in war time like during the Soviet Afghan war during which my father served in the military  And as we know  desparate times sometimes produce desparate measures   I apologize for this rather unpleasant question and the long post  but I thought it was necessary to lay it out more precisely than to keep it short  You would help me greatly with settling an inner conflict of rationally knowing he absolutely could have done it  but emotionally not wanting to accept it   So I would like to thank anyone who could share some insight  point me in a direction to research  etc  I appreciate your help greatly   Thank you and I hope you all have a more pleasant day than I had,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/i0tbmr/soviet_speznas_units_their_training_psychological/

history,2020-07-22 19:03:03,Benjamin Franklin wrote a satirical response to James Jackson s speech on slavery,hvwf3m,706,96,The letter is as follows      On the Slave Trade      To the Editor of the    Federal Gazette    March 23d  1790     Sir     Reading last night in your excellent Paper the speech of Mr  Jackson in Congress against their meddling with the Affair of Slavery  or attempting to mend the Condition of the Slaves  it put me in mind of a similar One made about 100 Years since by Sidi Mehemet Ibrahim  a member of the Divan of Algiers  which may be seen in Martin s Account of his Consulship  anno 1687  It was against granting the Petition of the Sect called Erika  or Purists who pray d for the Abolition of Piracy and Slavery as being unjust  Mr  Jackson does not quote it  perhaps he has not seen it  If  therefore  some of its Reasonings are to be found in his eloquent Speech  it may only show that men s Interests and Intellects operate and are operated on with surprising similarity in all Countries and Climates  when under similar Circumstances  The African s Speech  as translated  is as follows      Allah Bismillah   c  God is great  and Mahomet is his Prophet      Have these Erika considered the Consequences of granting their Petition  If we cease our Cruises against the Christians  how shall we be furnished with the Commodities their Countries produce  and which are so necessary for us  If we forbear to make Slaves of their People  who in this hot Climate are to cultivate our Lands  Who are to perform the common Labours of our City  and in our Families  Must we not then be our own Slaves  And is there not more Compassion and more Favour due to us as Mussulmen  than to these Christian Dogs  We have now about 50 000 Slaves in and near Algiers  This Number  if not kept up by fresh Supplies  will soon diminish  and be gradually annihilated  If we then cease taking and plundering the Infidel Ships  and making Slaves of the Seamen and Passengers  our Lands will become of no Value for want of Cultivation  the Rents of Houses in the City will sink one half  and the Revenues of Government arising from its Share of Prizes be totally destroy d  And for what  To gratify the whims of a whimsical Sect  who would have us  not only forbear making more Slaves  but even to manumit those we have      But who is to indemnify their Masters for the Loss  Will the State do it  Is our Treasury sufficient  Will the Erika do it  Can they do it  Or would they  to do what they think Justice to the Slaves  do a greater Injustice to the Owners  And it we set our Slaves free  what is to be done with them  Few of them will return to their Countries  they know too well the great Hardships they must there be subject to  they will not embrace our holy Religion  they will not adopt our Manners  our People will not pollute themselves by intermarrying with them  Must we maintain them as Beggars in our Streets  or suffer our Properties to be the Prey of their Pillage  For men long accustom d to Slavery will not work for a Livelihood when not compell d  And what is there so pitiable in their present Condition  Were they not Slaves in their own Countries      Are not Spain  Portugal  France  and the Italian states govern d by Despots  who hold all their Subjects in Slavery  without Exception  Even England treats its Sailors as Slaves  for they are  whenever the Government pleases  seiz d  and confin d in Ships of War  condemn d not only to work  but to fight  for small Wages  or a mere Subsistence  not better than our Slaves are allow d by us  Is their Condition then made worse by their falling into our Hands  No  they have only exchanged on Slavery for another  and I may say a better  for here they are brought into a land where the Sun of Islamism gives forth its Light  and shines in full Splendor  and they have an Opportunity of making themselves acquainted with the true Doctrine  and thereby saving their immortal Souls  Those who remain at home have not that Happiness  Sending the Slaves home then would be sending them out of Light into Darkness      I repeat the Question  What is to be done with them  I have heard it suggested  that they may be planted in the Wilderness  where there is plenty of Land for them to subsist on  and where they may flourish as a free State  but they are  I doubt  to little dispos d to labour without Compulsion  as well as too ignorant to establish a good government  and the wild Arabs would soon molest and destroy or again enslave them  While serving us  we take care to provide them with every thing  and they are treated with Humanity  The Labourers in their own Country are  as I am well informed  worse fed  lodged  and cloathed  The Condition of most of them is therefore already mended  and requires no further Improvement  Here their Lives are in Safety  They are not liable to be impress d for Soldiers  and forc d to cut one another s Christian throats  as in the Wars of their own Countries  If some of the religious mad Bigots  who now teaze us with their silly Petitions  have in a Fit of blind Zeal freed their Slaves  it was not Generosity  it was not Humanity  that mov d them to the Action  it was from the conscious Burthen of a Load of Sins  and Hope  from the supposed Merits of so good a Work  to be excus d Damnation      How grossly are they mistaken in imagining Slavery to be disallow d by the Alcoran  Are not the two Precepts  to quote no more   Masters  treat your Slaves with kindness  Slaves  serve your Masters with Cheerfulness and Fidelity   clear Proofs to the contrary  Nor can the Plundering of Infidels be in that sacred Book forbidden  since it is well known from it  that God has given the World  and all that it contains  to his faithful Mussulmen  who are to enjoy it of Right as fast as they conquer it  Let us then hear no more of this detestable Proposition  the Manumission of Christian Slaves  the Adoption of which would  by depreciating our Lands and Houses  and thereby depriving so many good Citizens of their Properties  create universal Discontent  and provoke Insurrections  to the endangering of Government and producing general Confusion  I have therefore no doubt  but this wise Council will prefer the Comfort and Happiness of a whole Nation of true Believers to the Whim of a few Erika  and dismiss their Petition      The Result was  as Martin tells us  that the Divan came to this Resolution   The Doctrine  that Plundering and Enslaving the Christians is unjust  is at best problematical  but that it is the Interest of this State to continue the Practice  is clear  therefore let the Petition be rejected      And it was rejected accordingly     And since like Motives are apt to produce in the Minds of Men like Opinions and Resolutions  may we not  Mr  Brown  venture to predict  from this Account  that the Petitions to the Parliament of England for abolishing the Slave Trade  to say nothing of other Legislatures  and the Debates upon them  will have a similar Conclusion  I am  Sir  your constant Reader and humble Servant     HISTORICUS     Source    Historicus  of course  was Ben Franklin s

history,2020-07-22 11:48:42,The issue of objectivity when learning about history   how come history teaching struggles with this ,hvq9qi,9,13,This is more of a response  to this post   that spurred me to write this because this is a question that has been bugging me for a while   When I started to look into history a while ago  I used to think that our understanding of history is done with the intention of being as objective as possible and state what actually happened instead of giving our interpretations of what happened or what might have happened or about the people that were involved   I know that history is not something that is set in stone like a hard science and it is something that is continuously being updated and examined as it involves our understanding of historical events and our interpretations of the different perspectives of historical events as some of the artefacts that also rely upon are documents that were written by the people of that time or written things even after that time has passed like     Herodotus who is also known as the Father of Lies because of his perspective of the Greeks on his publication of the Greco Persian Wars     or the Prose Edda which is one of the only few artifacts that we have about Norse Mythology was written way after the Viking Age has ended and writing was possibly influenced by the Christian influence of the time     x200B   But as I delve deeper into my understanding with different parts of human history  I keep on realising more than some of the things that I thought about history were debunked or updated  or some parts of history were overly focused upon while the others were neglected or given little attention  For example      I used to consider Winston Churchill as a hero for his bold leadership during WW2  especially during the early days of WW2  until I learned about the  Bengal famine of 1943     Or I used to think of Mother Teresa as that of a saint until I learned about  Christopher Hitchens    criticism against her actions including her use of faith healing  the lack of modernisation of her medical services despite the number of funds that she received and so on   Or I used to picture Nikola Tesla as this unheard and rejected genius and Edison as this greedy businessman  where before  I used to think that Edison was the genius behind the invention of the lightbulb  but apparently   the reality was more complicated      x200B   I am getting the impression that is the subject of either politicising history for personal agendas  or from the work of amateur historians whose inaccurate interpretations of history get into pop culture,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/hvq9qi/the_issue_of_objectivity_when_learning_about/

history,2020-07-18 16:37:34,Was George Washington thought of as a traitor among the British public or was he considered a  patriot  in a sense ,htgqe5,38,22,Most people think wrongly that the British public viewed the American colonists as somehow traitorous when openly rebelling against the King  rather most were ambivalent with keen enthusiasts on either sides of the debate  loyal monarchists with Tory inclinations vs supposed radical Whigs deeply antagonistic to the notion of a monarchy with heavy republican ideals   Both of these philosophies were birthed here in Britain  where the American Revolution was fought on the same lines as their forefather s war  the English Civil War  So called rebels of both wars claimed that their inalienable rights as Englishmen were taken away from them  thus the need to reestablish them via any means possible  The breaking point of the earlier English Civil War was King Charles I storming Parliament to arrest rebel MPs accused of spreading sedition  in response to Parliament banning any royal prerogatives to raise money and passing the  Grand Remonstrance   bill in Commons  a list of 204 grievances presented to the King including calling for the expulsion of all bishops from Parliament and Parliament having a right of veto over Crown appointments  sounds familiar I suppose   Another factor was the arrest of Puritan  John Lilburne   who coined the term  freeborn rights  and was arrested due to distributing seditious pamphlets  The apparent clamping down on the rights of Englishmen concerned the people of England  who swiftly took to two factions as the political atmosphere became apparent for all to see   This document issued by the Levellers is remarkably similar to the later Preamble of the US Constitution     We  the free People of England  to whom God hath given hearts  means and opportunity to effect the same  do with submission to his wisdom  in his name  and desiring the equity thereof may be to his praise and glory  agree to ascertain our Government to abolish all arbitrary Power  and to set bounds and limits both to our Supreme  and all Subordinate Authority  and remove all known Grievances  And accordingly do declare and publish to all the world  that we are agreed as followeth  1  That the Supreme Authority of England and the Territories therewith incorporate  shall be and reside henceforward in a Representative of the people consisting of four hundred persons  but no more  in the choice of whom  according to naturall right  all men of the age of one and twenty yeers and upwards  not being servants  or receiving alms  or having served with the late King in Arms or voluntary Contributions   shall have their voices      The abuse of the  Petition of Right     unlawful taxation and Puritanical distrust all culminated in this Civil War  where regicide has been committed  way before the famed French Revolution  This sent shockwaves throughout Europe as monarchies were threatened by the new Republic of England  who took to war against perceived royalist enemies in Ireland  where their Catholic faith was a huge problem for the newly Puritan leadership  The conflict sprawled over into the American Colonies where Royalists and Parliamentarians duked it out in Maryland and other colonies   Cromwell was highly regarded as a hero by many Puritans and republicans  and it was Washington who looked up to him as the archetype of the defence of English creeds and customs  So when these so called rights were threatened by a monarchy thousands of miles away  is George Washington truly a traitor for rebelling to preserve these sacred rights  I view Washington in the same league as Cromwell along with the figureheads of the Peasants Revolt  for truly rebellion is in the British psyche and Washington delivered himself a great nation which hold these rights in a codified constitution  truly honouring these long fought for rights honourably,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/htgqe5/was_george_washington_thought_of_as_a_traitor/

history,2020-07-18 08:56:16,On Vassalage in Medieval England and Japan ,htbp1u,6,3,The reason I picked these two countries is because despite being  textbook  examples of feudalism in west and east  both actually had a far more centralized structure of governance than is commonly realized  With King William the Conqueror starting from the ground up to deliberately parcel land NOT in accordance with continental practices  he wanted to avoid the mess that was France  and the various Shogunates at least trying to ape the Imperial bureaucracy  things get muddled up for me in trying to understand how local governance ties to the central authority  and who owed fealty to whom  So I hope some passing historian can shed some light on these matters   Now  my understanding of  classic feudalism  if there really ever was such a thing  is exemplified by two political entities  medieval France and  surprisingly enough  Zhou China  even if the latter based their power more in cities than fortresses   So  in both countries  barons owed fealty to counts  who owed fealty to dukes  who owed fealty to kings  Viscounts were barons who were usually the right hand man heir close relative of some count  and marquesses were counts who administered territories next to a foreign nation political entity  so border marcher lords   It was completely normal for a duke to have vassals who termed themselves counts  and for him to split off a section of his own territory  and create a county barony and set up a vassal of corresponding rank  The exact fealty hierarchy could get muddled at times  and large cities towns could be directly administered by the central authority  but the system described above was more or less how it went  Also  importantly  I believe that it was considered a breach of the political system if  under vassals  get poached by the top liege  So a baron who was sworn to a count who was sworn to a duke wouldn t normally try to find leadership from the liege of HIS liege  So no going to the duke or the king for judicial matters or permissions   Now on to England and Japan  Whenever I read about great noblemen of either countries I noticed that unlike French or German  or Ancient Chinese peers  they didn t have any vassals that were particularly high ranking  You don t hear of the Duke of York having Earls  English equivalent of count  as vassals  and you don t hear of the Daimyo of Satsuma Domain having an under daimyo  Their vassals usually were best described as landed knights samurai of varying degrees   So  to cut it short  was it possible to for an english noble to create ANOTHER english noble  When the king makes a baron into an earl  does he grant him overlordship over other barons  within a given area   Could a Japanese Daimyo create another Japanese Daimyo sworn to him  Did vassalage practices differ in between Shogunates  Well  I hope somebody answers my queries,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/htbp1u/on_vassalage_in_medieval_england_and_japan/

history,2020-07-16 19:14:06,The Rise of the Severans  Septimius Severus,hscfzz,4,4,If you think about Roman emperors  what comes into your mind  It s safe to say the Severan dynasty isn t the first thing you think about most of the time  But their rulers had a huge influence on the empire and deserve a second look  In this article  I want to show you their rise to power   The first of the five was Septimius Severus who obtained the throne after emerging victorious in the second year of the four emperors  It was a crucial year in the story  as it saw the aftermath of sudden assassination of Commodus  He was replaced by Pertinax who was assassinated after he failed to pay the Pretorians a bribe he had promised them earlier  Then  the throne was sold to highest bidder  Didius Julianus  with the Pretorians seeing the vacuum left by Pertinax as the perfect opportunity to cash in  Julianus wasn t popular and had no support from his people  so Septimius Severus and Pescennius Niger jumped at the opportunity  as they were proclaimed emperor by their armies  This was a bad situation for Julianus  but it was worsened by the fact he was unpopular  so the army just revolted and joined the two usurpers  Julianus decided to have Severus declared an enemy of the state  he sent a delegation to remind Septimius Severus that he was obligated to stay loyal to the emperor  then he sent a few men to kill Septimius  and then he tried to offer the throne as co emperor to Septimius Severus  but to no avail  Recognising the situation  the Senate deposed Julianus and recognised Severus as sole emperor  They also sentenced Julianus to death  He was executed on June 2nd 193 AD   This was a huge victory for Severus  but he was far from safe  Remember Pescennius Niger  He hadn t relinquished his claim to the throne and was prepared to fight Septimius Severus  His troops controlled large parts of the East  especially the province of Syria  one of the most wealthy ones of the empire  The war between the two saw Severus emerging victorious after a series of victories culminating in the decisive Battle of Issos in 194  an absolute victory  as Pescennius Niger was captured and soon murdered  With all the threats dealt with  he now focused on his newly obtained empire  especially on war and expansion    The Parthians under Vologases V  were very destabilized  and the opportunity was seized by Septimius Severus  invading twice in 195 and 197 198  even sacking Ctesiphon  the capital of the Parthians  This is why he was given the name  parthicus maximus   a title that only Trajan carried before   Meanwhile  the Senate had dwindling influence on the emperor  ad he gave more power to the armies  Essentially  Septimius acted as a military dictator and tried to ignore the Senate as well as he could  Why  Well  as it seems  another usurper by the name of Clodius Albinus had many supporters in the Senate  but was crushed in the Battle of Lugdunum in 197 and committed suicide as a consequence  Septimius Severus just couldn t trust them  so he restricted the power of the Senate by a lot  even though the Senate didn t have a lot of power anyway  but still  In fact  he was similar to the later emperors that reigned in the Crisis of the Third Century which he may have caused by accident   See  in order to be so popular with the soldiers  he doubled their salary  The problem is that about two thirds of the empire s income went into the army  before their salary was raised  so this was bound to cause some economical issues  To prevent having a huge pile of debt  he raised the taxes and devalued the currency by a huge amount  This move was very bad in the long run  but it helped him pay for the time being  These two things combined meant that the empire had less money later on  while being forced to pay soldiers with a higher  salary  Hadn t he raised the salary by so much  the crisis of the third century could have been avoided  the Severans could have maintained power for much longer if they hadn t put that burden on the economy  ultimately making them very unpopular with the Romans  He used the additional money he gained for further campaigns  expanding the empire further  Ironically  he died while campaigning in York in modern day England  His death was on February 4th 211   He named his sons Caracalla and Geta as his heirs  and in the next article  we ll look at their reign  a story of rivalry and hatred,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/hscfzz/the_rise_of_the_severans_septimius_severus/

history,2020-07-13 15:54:49, Hippies  in the 10th century  The Bogomilis and their theology,hqeqqq,49,5,I ran into one of the most fascinating religious movements of the middle ages  Bogomilism  This sect  founded by a village priest named Bogomil  beloved of God   was a dualistic interpretation of christianity  The movement began to spread in Bulgaria  around the year 930  In this interpretation the devil was responsible for the creation of the earth  by consequence  our world was inherently wicked  Two currents emerged  one where Satan was a  god  opposite to the Christian God  in a Manichaean conception of Christianity  and another  more moderate  where satan did not have a status equal to that of God  For the bogomils the cross was to be rejected  as it was the instrument of the torture of Christ  The virtues of the practitioners were  poverty  humility  penitence and prayer  The Bogomils neither ate meat or drank wine  and were against the institution of marriage  Their communities also had no hierarchy  as the movement criticized the rich and rejected control by the nobility  When opressed they protested by passive resistance  the movement was greatly encouraged by the way that Bulgarian peasants were treated by the Byzantine elite  Their rejection of the orthodox church was justified by the pomp and corruption that marked it in the eyes of the peasants   The movement grew in the Balkans and several autonomous peasant communities emerged  When the persecution of practitioners increased  the movement migrated north of the Balkans and several missionaries headed for Dalmatia  Italy and France  In France  missionaries would find some success  influencing the creation of the Cathar movement  brutally repressed in the Albigensian crusade  The Cathars  as the bogomils  believed that this world was the domain os Satan  consequently  everything in the material world was profane  Our world had been created by Satan to imprison the immortal souls in matter  In the west the Cathar movement met its demise in the brutal Albigensian crusade  in the east the bogomils survived until the Ottoman conquest of the Balkans  when most practitioners converted to Islam   The parallels between bogomilist movements and some modern anarchist ideologies are quite fascinating  The rejection of the material world  the belief that man should not inflict pain on the world  the sin of eating meat   Also  the rejection of institutions such as  social hierarchy  marriage and organized religion shows a striking similarity with the hippy movements of the 60 s and 70 s  Of course  comparisons like this can be quite anachronistic  but many things in history show us the different reactions of societies when oppressed or ignored  The idea of   passive resistance also resembles much of what was preached in certain ideologies in the 20th century  Running into this subject greatly changed my perception of the various ways that religious movements of the Middle Ages manifested themselves   Some additional literature on the subject   The History of Religious Ideias vol  3 by Mircea Eliade  Chapter 37   Religious Movements in Europe  From the Late Middle Ages to the Eve of the Reformation  1976   Christian Dualist Heresies in the Byzantine World  C  650 C  1450 by J  Hamilton  Bernard Hamilton  and Yuri Stoyanov  1998   Dualist Heresy in the Middle Ages by M  Loos  1972   English is not my native language so please forgive any mistakes,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/hqeqqq/hippies_in_the_10th_century_the_bogomilis_and/

history,2020-07-11 18:58:33,Erich Mielke  how one of the most terrible officials became nothing more like a joke to an entire nation in months,hpcckx,11,2,Estern German 1957  Erich Mielke is officially appointed head of the MfS  Ministerium für Staatssicherheit   Ministry of state security  by the Chairman of the Council of State Walter Ulbricht  He was engaged in the building of eastern Germany s intelligence service  MfS  since the day it was founded   When he took over the efforts of the ministry were rather small with a mere 14 000 full time employees  Over the years under his leadership  the MfS became an every bigger growing operation with 1989 about 90 000 full time employees like spies and up to nearly 200 000 IMs   inofficial employees    who were basically normal citizens that reported any  behaviour against the state  they noticed in their everyday life Their practices included cruel types of questioning to subjects  like questioning for 30 hours straight to break down people into admitting whatever they were told or threatening to take familiy members jobs  university enrolments etc  Another very common practice was to wiretap entire flats in only a few minutes  tapping all phone calls  reading all mail etc   The people of the GDR very well knew about that ministry and their doings and their full time spies often looked comically similar  But the threat the people recognized that anyone could be an IM  from the girl boy you just met  to any person at your workplace  to your own family and friends  Also  people who weren t actually IMs but heard something and wanted a benefit for themselves or hurt the other person could report to the ministry Thinking about the crude consequences for yourself or your family being caught talking badly about the state often  but really not always  stopped many people from even secretly criticising the government  This making Mielke responsible for creating one of the most feared entities in the GDR   On 9th November 1989  the Berlin Wall fell  On the one hand  it meant people from the east could leave  but also western people and media could enter   On 13th November 1989  Mielke gave his last speech in parliament  in which he also was a member   The entire world can see him  everyone knows what s going own  his own MfS lost almost power since all their doing can be openly seen now  The politicians of the opposition feel strengthen since they have the west in their back and could leave and the GDR cannot afford the political pressure around political arrests When Mielke talks he only addresses his socialist  comrades   Genossen  when a politician from the opposition stood up and told him that there is also non comrades present  His next sentence will cause laughter and him losing his last political positions    but I love all of you       said the guy who literally tracked down everyone who isn t socialist and pro GDR enough for decades   In case you are interested in the short clip from the parliamentary session I will link it below  but it s obviously in German  But I think if you read this you can recognize what he said when and where    ,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/hpcckx/erich_mielke_how_one_of_the_most_terrible/

history,2020-07-10 19:45:21,Fritz Bauer and the de Nazification of Germany in the 1960s,hoscva,17,7,This article is a follow up to one of my previous articles  which explains the flaws the  original  de Nazifaction in the late 1940s and 1950s had  You can find it here       Germany took it s time to start to publicly discuss the Third Reich  The discussion started in the early 1960s for several reasons  In this article  I want to showcase the main reasons to give you a general understanding of the why and the what of the change     A new generation    Imagine you re a child born in the  timely  middle of the Third Reich  something like 1940  You remember your parents wearing e g  nazi uniforms  being schooled all about the  Great Leader  of your country and in general you know how much you and your family were involved in the system  When you re 18 and an adult  1958  and start studying you focus on your career path  you won t question the time in which you know your family was so involved   Now imagine being a child at the end of the Third Reich or a few years later  maybe 1945  You won t know the Third Reich from your memories and be 18 in 1963  At the same time  you hear about a trial against a Nazi who was responsible for the death of over 600 000 innocent people on TV or maybe you get a piece of paper with some information about the German past in the University  very common   You start thinking  Who were the nazis  Why didn t I learn anything about them  Where my Parents Nazis  Did they do those terrible things to millions of innocent people  etc   The generation that was born 1945 or later  started to question the past of their country and of their family  Most families were involved in the Third Reich and thus the parents didn t have a satisfying answer  Thus the young people who discover the past of their family  teachers  tutors  politicians  etc  started to advocate strong reforms and formed the generational divide that would later  1968  lead up to the student s protests in Germany     Fritz Bauer    Fritz Bauer was the youngest ever judge in the Weimar Republic and the son of German nationalist Jewish parents  He grew up without being Jewish  or religious at all  and also didn t carry over the nationalism of his parents but joined the social democratic party  During the Third Reich  he was sacked of his position as a successful judge  sent to a concentration camp twice before fleeing to Scandinavia till the end of the war   After the war he came back being a judge  later being promoted as attorney general of the German state of Hesse  In this position  he decided to take matters into his own hand and creating one big single trial against all the free Nazis that were responsible for the atrocities  especially in Auschwitz  Doing this wasn t easy since the German justice and intelligence services  especially the high ranking officials  were mostly ex Nazis with a past they wanted to keep secret  His probably most famous quote is  When I leave my office  I am entering enemy territory   perfectly describing his situation     Eichmann Trial    Adolf Eichmann is often considered one of the main organizers of the holocaust  him taking place in the  Wannsee Konferenz  where the  final solution  was determined and later organizing trains to send jews into certain death   He flew to Argentina through Vatican City after WW2 where he secretly lived  like many other Nazis   One Lothar Hermann  a Jew who was enslaved in a concentration camp during the Third Reich identified him and decided to write a letter to   Fritz Bauer    Bauer was determined to make Eichmann the first mainly responsible Nazi in front of a German court  but there was a problem  the German intelligence service and justice wouldn t capture and trial him  but warn him or let him off  That s why he secretly got in contact with the Israeli Mossad  a move that could have cost him a long prison sentence   Mossad captured Eichmann and he was sentenced to death in 1962 in Israel and thus for the first time post 1945 having a trial with big media attention  The role of Fritz Bauer stayed a secret till his death in 1968     Frankfurt Auschwitz Trials    This was the invention of   Fritz Bauer    the big trial against many of the staff of Auschwitz  The trials held a place in Frankfurt  a big city in the German state of Hesse  where Bauer was attorney general     The first trial had 21 defendants  from commanders to lower ranks of the Auschwitz personnel  e g  the people who decided who was to be gassed and who wasn t  360 witnesses were heard before the judges  with the sessions often having to be paused because the judges  attorneys  witnesses  and viewers being in tears and horror after what they heard   The main effect was outside the court though  This time a German court ruled and people took it more seriously and first and foremost  the defendants looked like the most ordinary people  They weren t looking frightening or anything special  many saw someone who looked like their dad or their husband    slowly but surely the thought came through  the Nazis weren t just Hitler and Himmler  anyone could have been part    maybe my neighbor  my family  anyone  I know   This psychological realization was key in the journey of Germany to where it is now  with the probably  fittingly  most brutal and honest view and education about their  in my case  our  history  Yes  there were some Nazis in office afterward  but far not as many  Trials like that  against subordinates  take place to this date   The most important lesson Germany learned is that something like the Shoah can t ever happen again and that it takes a society to do something like this  not a few radicals  Today  almost  all Germans aren t guilty of the Holocaust  but we are responsible for never allowing anything like this ever again     x200B   Thank you for reading this article  I feel like this is a really niche topic for post 1950 history  but crucial for all German history in the 1960s and thus crucial in the cold war  An upvote would be appreciated,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/hoscva/fritz_bauer_and_the_denazification_of_germany_in/

history,2020-07-10 18:35:31,The unsuccessful de Nazification of Germany after the second world war,hor30m,0,9,1943  The allies publish a statement regarding the knowledge over the German atrocities towards Jews and other victims  now known as  Shoah   Besides the publishing of their knowledge they publicly announce a criminal investigation after the victory against the responsible people   1945  All concentration camps are freed  the battle in Europe ends with the total capitulation of the Third Reich  The allies organize a juridical novelty that changed Law forever  the Nuremberg trials   For most  this is where the history of the Nazis ends  but unfortunately  it isn t     Nuremberg trials       Yes  high ranking Nazis like Göring or Heß could be evicted   Yes  at least in the beginning the media attention on the trials was high But   Often the defendants got a rather mild punishment  often later being softened even more or being let off without any punishment   Many German s regarded the trials as mere  victor s justice  and didn t pay much interest in the facts of the trial   And most importantly  There wasn t a single person who was mainly responsible for the Shoah itself  Hitler killed himself  Himmler killed himself  Heydrich was killed by partisans  Eichmann ran away     A policy of silence    The new German chancellor Konrad Adenauer and his Government decided it s best for Germany to not talk about what happened before and purely focus on the rebuilding  This policy was carried on till late in the 1960s and the effects will be discussed in the following points    Nazi officials in the new German system    Because the Nuremberg trial only concerned a few people central to the Nazis during their reign most people weren t considered at all and their role during that time was never disclosed Because of that many teachers who taught Nazi Ideology for the past decade  just took off their swastika and started teaching children in the  new  Germany The same goes for any officials  Because of that for example  90  of Bavarian Judges were previously Judges  Every third official of the ministry of foreign affairs just carried on their previous work in the  new  Germany  And as the last example the previous high ranking Gestapo  Third Reich intelligence services  very much involved with the search for hiding jews  official Reinhard Gehlen was trusted with the job of creating the intelligence of the FRG   I think it s very obvious to see that in that climate no one is interested in talking about the atrocities of Germany in the Second World War  Teachers won t teach the kids  else they ask questions  Judge s won t convict anyone for anything Nazi related  The national intelligence agency won t start major investigations against ex nazis     High ranking Nazi officials in new high ranking positions    The problem we just discussed didn t just occur with the low ranking officials but went up to the highest office  The President of the Federal Republic of Germany   Let s start with Friedrich Flick  He was convicted in the Nuremberg trials of having used the work of  enslaved  jews  1947 he was sentenced to seven years in prison but released after two years  In the 1950s he was back being the richest German and the majority shareholder of many big companies like Mercedes Benz Other rich ex Nazis included the like of Rudolf August Oetker  who was the head of the company Dr  Oetker  He joined the NSDAP  Nazi Party   SA  and later SS on his own and was a strong advocate of the Nazi Ideology   As already mentioned  the new German intelligence agency  Bundesnachrichtendienst  was founded and lead by the former Gestapo official Reinhard Gehlen   In 1966 Kurt Georg Kiesinger  who previously was a high ranking official in the agency of Foreign affairs  NSDAP member  and suspect of knowing about the holocaust whilst still preceding to work for the Third Reich   became chancellor and thus Head of government in the  new  Germany   Lastly also the formally most powerful office in the FRG   the president   was held by Ex Nazi s  Twice  First Karl Carstens  Later Walter Scheel  who also was chancellor for a few days      No interest of the allies to investigate    Almost seamlessly after the second world war the former allies and the soviet union fall into the next conflict  the cold war  This had a big impact on the interest of  especially  the US to investigate ex Nazis   Germany was in a unique and important position during the cold war and the US didn t want to take any chances with Germany  Whilst they probably recognized the aforementioned flaws in the new system investigating and changing it wasn t in their interest   If the high ranking officials would have been  endangered  of bein convicted by the US  the Soviet Union would have promised immunity to everyone and may have lead Germany to approximate to it If the US would convict the rich German s like Frick  again  it would strongly harm the economy  but the strong economy was of interest to the US     x200B     Conclusion    The Nuremberg trials were a revolution in modern legal history but had only little impact on most Germans  leaving most who did bad during the Third Reich completely unaffected  That s why the entire system from top to bottom was full of former Nazis  causing and strengthening a policy focused on rebuilding  not talking about the past  Outside powers like the US that could have solved the problem found themselves in the cold war and thus not having any interest in weakening their allies     x200B   You may ask how this situation resolved and creating the new German education policy  which makes Germany s dark part central to education      PS  I am

history,2020-07-10 04:02:34,Why would independent dukes and other lesser sovereigns not declare themselves kings ,hoff27,6,6,Something I ve encountered that I haven t been able to find an explanation for is why independent rulers with  lesser  titles such as Prince  Duke  Grand Duke  or even Archduke  would not simply call themselves  King of So and So  instead of keeping the lesser title  I imagine there had to have been a certain prestige connected to being a king rather than a duke  so why would those with no liege lord to answer to not go for the bump in fame and  seemingly  renown   I m aware of the historical connection between western European empires and the legacy of Rome  but as far as I know there was no similar situation with kingship or kings either there or elsewhere in the world  So what causes a duchy or its duke to remain as such  rather than claiming a higher title and distancing themselves from any possible revanchist ideals,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/hoff27/why_would_independent_dukes_and_other_lesser/

history,2020-07-09 23:11:58,American Civil War History,hoacs1,7,5,I sent this to my family  and thought it might be worth posting here  given the one topic a few days back about the cause of the Civil War   I seem to go down an online rabbit hole about the US Civil War probably once a year or so  and I feel like I learn more every time  I learned quite a bit this latest go  and thought I d share   I ve known that a large number of people in the South  where I live  fervently believe that the civil war was about states  rights  not slavery  And  I ve known that this was a view that was perpetuated very early after  the civil war by groups like  apparently predominantly  the United  Daughters of the Confederacy  They were also  I m learning  the  predominant force behind a large amount of the  Southern Monuments      I watched  this video   about the UDC  While I found it informative  it does have a  strong  bias  For example  they make it sound terrible that anyone would do their best to ensure that the children in the South know that their ancestors weren t 100  evil  o _o    Going back to the reasons for the civil war  I ve been doing more digging  In  the past  in support of the view that it was only about states  rights   I ve heard arguments using the following facts     Only a  small percentage of Southerners owned slaves  so that doesn t explain  why the states as a whole would fight against the Union  The number  commonly touted online is 1 6   though that is the percentage of  slaveholders in the entire union  not just the South    Slavery was already on the decline  and would ve died out on its own  Thus  the war was not over the issue of slavery    Lincoln  was not an abolitionist  and while he abhored slavery  he had no  intention of ending slavery in the South during his presidency  nor was  it an original reason for the war  It only became a factor of the  conflict towards the end    Grant said that if he thought the war was to abolish slavery  he would resign his comission and offer his  sword to the other side    Tariffs had been imposed that were extremely unfair to the South  and this was a primary motivation for secession      One the side of it being primarily about slavery  I ve heard the following facts     The tongue in cheek argument that   It s about states  rights    to what    hold slaves being the rhetorical answer     Several states made it very clear that their reasons for secession were for the  preservation of slavery    and their  state s  right to do so  For example  during the Alabama secession convention  G T  Yleverton said     The question of Slavery is the rock upon which the Old Government split  it is the cause of secession     Several  higher ups in the Confederate Army and the Confederacy as a whole were also vocal about the reason they were fighting  for their right to keep slaves    Slavery was indeed on the decline    and Southern states saw this as a threat  The Union had placed more and more restrictions  on the slave trade  including not allowing it to extend to new  territories  The South saw it as only a matter of time until the North came for their slaves  The election of Abraham Lincoln was the final  trigger  while he stated he wouldn t end slavery  Southern states new he vocally disapproved of it  The South saw all of this as an attack on  their way of life  and feared economic collapse if slavery was  abolished   But today I learned even more  and wanted to share     As a counterpoint to the small percentage of slaveholders in the South pointing to why it couldn t be the primary cause of war       If you look at  families  that owned slaves  not just the heads of households  the  numbers average around 31     and up to 49  in Mississippi        People also regularly  rented slaves   from slave owners  meaning the statistic doesn t fully represent the impact of slavery       With  such a large impact  slavery was part of society  Even if you didn t  personally own or hold slaves  you likely benefited from it  and you  likely aspired to it as a symbol of wealth  As stated  Southerners did  fear economic collapse if the slave trade was abolished  It wouldn t  have been hard to convince non slave holders to fight  though as referenced in a  previous link    more than half of the officers in 1861 owned slaves themselves  and 33   of enlisted men owned slaves or lived with family who did     The prevalence of slaveholding was so pervasive among Southerners who heeded the call to arms in 1861 that it became something of a joke   Glatthaar tells of an Irish born private in a Georgia regiment who  quipped to his messmates that  he bought a negro  he says  to have  something to fight for         The full quote from Grant is told like this     In the summer of 1861 General Grant  then Colonel of the Twenty first  Illinois regiment of Infantry  was stationed at Mexico on the  North Missouri Railroad   and had command of the post     In a public  conversation in Kingo s banking house  a sterling Union man put this  question to him   What do you honestly think was the real object of this  war on the part of the Federal Government            Sir   said Grant    I have no doubt in the world that the sole object is the restoration of  the Union  I will say further  though  that I am a Democrat   every man  in my regiment is a Democrat   and when ever I shall be convinced that  this war has for its object anything else than what I have mentioned  or  that the Government designs to use its soldiers to execute the purposes of the Abolitionists  I pledge you my honor as a man and a soldier that  I wilt not only resign my commission  but will carry my sword to the  other side  and cast my lot with that people         The  Tariff of Abominations   exploited the South  and  South Carolina declared it unconstitutional and therefore null and void    After some back and forth  Congress authorized the President to use military force against SC  but also negotiated a new Compromise Tariff   SC was appeased and repealed its nullification     But then came the new  Morrill Tariff    which more than doubled collected rates  It was passed on March 2  1861  On March 4  Lincoln gave his first inaugural address  where he  threatened to invade states   that didn t collect the Tariff  making evil eyes at SC   Fort Sumter  this viewpoint claims  was a tariff collection point in Charleston Harbor  and was where the war began    However  while a couple of these links insinuate the Morrill Tariff was a major factor in the states seceding  and during the  secession debates in GA and SC the pending tariff was verbally  attacked  a counterargument to this is that the states seceded  before  the tariff was passed  And in fact  it is believed by some that the only way the tariff passed was  because  the South had already seceded  Further  I ll quote  Wikipedia   here     According to Luthin in the 1940s   Historians are not unanimous as to  the relative importance which Southern fear and hatred of a high tariff  had in causing the secession of the slave states    However  none of the statesmen seeking a compromise in 1860 61 that  would avert the war ever suggested the tariff might be the key to a  solution  or might be a cause of the secession     Finally  the only references I can find to Sumter being a tariff collection point are in Tariff War viewpoint propaganda pieces  Everywhere else references the fact that it was a Fort  I was for coastal defense  And it wasn t fully constructed and was barely staffed       Battlefields org has some great pages about the reasons for the secession  and how it s difficult to distinguish the exact reasons    This page   breaks down some of the  source documents   Four  states  in addition to their basic Articles of Secession  which were  often just a couple of paragraphs long  released Declarations of Causes  explaining their decisions  The analysis is in the previous link  while  this link    has those four documents in full  It is staggering  Short version  the  analysis shows that over half the documents were spent discussing  slavery as a reason for secession for three of the four states  Only SC  emphasized States  Rights as their reason for secession    37  of their  document  vs 20  devoted to slavery as the reason    This particular paragraph from Texas really floored me     In all the non slave holding States  in violation of that good faith and  comity which should exist between entirely distinct nations  the people  have formed themselves into a great sectional party  now strong enough  in numbers to control the affairs of each of those States  based upon an  unnatural feeling of hostility to these Southern States and their  beneficent and patriarchal system of African slavery      proclaiming the   debasing doctrine   of equality of all men  irrespective of race or  color   a doctrine at war with nature  in opposition to the experience  of mankind  and in violation of the plainest revelations of Divine Law       They demand the abolition of negro slavery throughout the confederacy   the recognition of political equality between the white and negro races   and avow their determination to press on their crusade against us  so  long as a negro slave remains in these States      emphasis mine    Debasing doctrine  Wow  Just    wow       The Southern states felt that the Union  was a compact   and that they could leave it if they weren t satisfied  In particular   they viewed the North s unwillingness to widely enforce the Fugitive Slave Act  requiring the return of slaves     Wisconsin even declared it  unconstitutional and nullified it     as being a breach of trust  and felt that they had the right to  therefore  leave the Union     Others felt that  while this option was true of the Articles of Confederation  once those had been replaced by the Constitution    a  more perfect union    per Lincoln    that the Union was permanent  and the option of secession no longer existed  and was in fact illegal  In fact  when New  York  joined the Union      the anti federalists sought to insert into the New York ratification  message language to the effect that  there should be reserved to the  state of New York a right to withdraw herself from the union after a  certain number of years    The Madison federalists opposed this  with Hamilton  a delegate at the  Convention  reading aloud in response a letter from James Madison  stating   the Constitution requires an adoption in toto  and for ever   Hamilton and   John Jay    then told the Convention that in their view  reserving  a right to  withdraw   was   inconsistent with the Constitution  and was no  ratification         To follow this up  the  South offered to buy   Federal properties    like Fort Sumter    and enter into a treaty with  the Union  Lincoln rejected this because he didn t consider the Confederacy a legitimate nation    and in fact  considered them still  part of the Union  the mail system  for example  was still running      While some of the Tariff War viewpoint links from earlier paint a picture of Lincoln blasting the South with tariffs  then baiting them into opening fire  then using slavery as a means to manipulate Northern sentiment     that s just not true  He refused to recognize the legitimacy of the Confederacy  likely underestimating how widespread anti Union sentiment  was in the South  and treated them like they didn t legally exist  He communicated with the governor of SC  and not the Confederate government  The Confederate government ordered Fort Sumter to be  blockaded and demanded its surrender  The Major in charge agreed to  evacuate once their supplies ran out unless he received new orders or new supplies  The Confederate side decided this wasn t good enough and  notified them they were going to open fire    The back and forth is  quite a read     Note  elsewhere I read that Jackson claimed they never heard back from the Fort  and therefore opened fire o _o       Finally  Wikipedia has some excellent    if a bit    Wikipedia like    pages on the Civil War  including  this section    detailing the many causes of secession  Notice that most of them  while  not explicitly  slavery     are in fact related to slavery    So  I feel like I have a more complete understanding now    When someone says  The Civil War wasn t about slavery  it was about States  Rights     I believe that is  technically  true     The   War   was about preserving the Union    But   Secession   was  almost entirely  about slavery     That  led  to the Civil War  because the South believed they had the  state   right  to secede and Lincoln believed they did not  He tried to ignore them and wait things out  and they attacked      So to answer that tongue in cheek question   the States  Rights    to what    the answer would be  to secede       Primarily  so they could preserve the institution of slavery  ,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/hoacs1/american_civil_war_history/
history,2020-07-09 22:41:00,Is there much information about what happened to the remains of Prussian Field Marshal Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher after 1945 ,ho9ru2,6,0,Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher was a Prussian Field Marshal fighting against Napoleon during the last Coalition War and is well known for his innovations in the field of strategy  In 1819  he was buried in Krieblowitz  now part of Poland but then part of Prussia   From what I have gathered  almost all sources agree on his mausoleum being destroyed during the Second World War and Soviet conquest of the town  What is of specific interest to me is the claim that Soviet soldiers severely desecrated his remains  though I have found only one source that claims as such  which is  Blücher  Scourge of Napoleon  by Michael Leggiere  It uses the word  reportedly  on the desecration  so I am very unsure who could have reported it and if the Source is believable  Soviet soldiers did commit many atrocities during their Conquest of Eastern Europe from Nazi Rule  but this seems to macabre for even them to do  especially since the person in question would probably be unknown to them anyway  It is also said that apparently some of his remains were buried by a Polish priest  but only in 1989  which implies that the destroyed mausoleum would simply have been left there with no changes made to it in half a century  something I find hard to believe,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/ho9ru2/is_there_much_information_about_what_happened_to/

history,2020-07-08 02:39:24,Discussing the advantages of the pre Marian Roman military system over its contemporaries,hn5wb6,3,0,Hi fellow redditors of r history    In recent times I heard and read a lot of opinions on why the Romans managed to beat and conquered all of the traditionally predominant military powers surrounding the Mediterranean   It usually bogs down to there being an inherent advantage over other military systems  with most emphasis being put on there being a uniquely deep command structure  enabling centurions to command their men exceptionally flexibly    Whilst I believe this to be true to some point  the Romans certainly were not the only civilization with such a dedicated command structure  though perhaps it was a prerequisite for other factors coming into play  which I believe to have been far more important to the eventual success of the Legions in the field   Another point that is often made is the reliance of the Romans on the Italian Socii and I also believe it was of utmost importance  It certainly was a force multiplier by a factor of 2  there usually being parity in Socii and Roman forces in the field  It also strikes way closer to the point I wish to make as what I gather were the actual distinguishing factors   I believe that the greatest advantages the pre Marian republican Roman army held over other contemporaries was its unique combination of a vast manpower pool and a martial society that refused to give in    These two enabled the Roman state to simply absorb staggering losses that would have knocked out other powers instantaneously  Roman society was capable and  to a point  willing to pump out heavy infantry troops of average quality in rapid succession   Simply put  if the Romans weren t able to beat similarly capable or even better performing armies outright  the Romans usually simply outlasted them in a contest of endurance   Pyrrhus noted the rapidity of the Roman recruitment after beating them and in both the first and the second Punic wars their reserves and martial culture let them stay in wars that would have pushed most other powers to the breaking point   Additionally to there being an inherent advantage of just being able to lose massive armies with disproportionally negligible consequences  this endurance usually over time increased the quality of Roman troops until they could match enemies that had originally been superior in the field   I gather this happened because even if the Romans were beat in battles or even on whole fronts  they usually were able to operate at least on par on other fronts  slowly familiarising and accustoming the average Legionary to military drill  unit cohesion and army manoeuvering over years of constant warfare   Especially long wars tended to produce whole generations of competent soldiers and officers  The second Punic war basically trained the entirety of the Roman military aged population into semi professional soldiers  with the end of the war in my opinion marking the point of the pre Marian Legion s highpoint   It was these men who beat Hannibal at Zama  Phillip V  at Cynoscephalae  Antiochus III  at Magnesia  I suspect it was grizzled veterans in the ranks and in the officer corps who upheld the spirits of discipline and professionalism even until the Roman victory over Perseus at Pydna   So I don t really think the Roman Army was institutionally superior to its contemporaries  I d even go as far as saying that some armies had far more professional military institutions  like the Seleucids and the Carthaginians    I believe it was this unique combination of a vast military manpower and bulldogedness  that enabled the Romans to stay in any fight  with them overcoming their enemies simply by virtue of having the leisure to grow experienced in war   Put into context of the 2nd Century BC  the rapid conquest and subjugation of most of the Mediterranean powers IMO was simply a byproduct of the second Punic war  Had Hannibal not driven the Romans to such lengths  they might not have been in a position to beat the Macedonian armies of the Antigonids and the Seleucids in such a spectacular fashion as they did    In fact  after Pydna  we can notice a steep decline in performance of the average Roman legion  legionary and general  Even notably competent generals like Scipio Aemilianus lost control over their troops   But by then  the economical changes to Roman society brought into it by the enormous wealth of the Mediterranean conquests and the resulting inequalities had inexorably damaged the socioeconomic basis of the  in my opinion to this day  unique war machine   But that is just my view  and I would love to read you guys countering it with your own arguments  so please  feel free to comment and discuss with me,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/hn5wb6/discussing_the_advantages_of_the_premarian_roman/

history,2020-07-04 01:30:14,If you don t know what  The Black National Anthem  is  allow me to offer you this listening experience  and brief history lesson ,hksco9,4,2, Lift Every Voice and Sing  was written as a poem by James Weldon Johnson in 1900 and set to music by his brother  J  Rosamond Johnson in 1905  As with most pieces of music  it is important to understand the context around the time this was written   Around 1900  lynchings of African Americans were common  We re talking over 100 documented lynchings per year leading up to 1900  Library of Congress    This was socially acceptable at the time for a many reasons  but notably because the institutions of government allowed it     In 1863  The Emancipation Proclamation was signed by Abraham Lincoln  As many of us have recently learned  the last slaves to hear about their freedom learned about it two and a half years later  on June 19th  1865  Juneteenth     In 1882  the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871  which was passed by congress  and gave then president  Ulysses S  Grant the authority to use military force to suppress the KKK  was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court    In 1883  the Civil Rights Act was overturned by the Supreme Court  who claimed the 14th Amendment forbids states   but not citizens   from discriminating    In 1890  The Mississippi Plan was approved  which targeted black American citizens by testing for literacy and  understanding  to disenfranchise African Americans  Similar policies were adopted by South Carolina  1895   Louisiana  1898   North Carolina  1900   Alabama  1901   Virginia  1901   Georgia  1908   and Oklahoma  1910     In 1896   Plessy v  Ferguson  ruled that  separate  but equal  facilities satisfy the 14th Amendment  giving legal sanction to Jim Crow segregation laws   To summarize  African Americans were granted freedom  and it took  decades  for the government to set policies in place to help them overcome discrimination  But we re still only looking at 1900  Jim Crow laws did not end until 1964  101 years after slavery legally ended  when Lyndon B  Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act  so we re still in the thick of segregation here   The Spanish American War also started in 1898 and saw 16 regiments of black volunteers  Five black Americans received Congressional Medals of Honor  Do you think these men received a hero s welcome  No  They served their country and had to use different toilets  different drinking fountains  sit in the back of the bus  and were legally treated as subhuman by many   Here are the lyrics to  Lift Every Voice and Sing    Lift ev ry voice and sing      Til earth and heaven ring     Ring with the harmonies of Liberty    Let our rejoicing rise     High as the list ning skies     Let it resound loud as the rolling sea    Sing a song full of the faith that the dark past has taught us     Sing a song full of the hope that the present has brought us    Facing the rising sun of our new day begun     Let us march on  til victory is won    Stony the road we trod     Bitter the chastening rod     Felt in the days when hope unborn had died    Yet with a steady beat     Have not our weary feet     Come to the place for which our fathers died     We have come over a way that with tears has been watered     We have come  treading our path through the blood of the slaughtered    Out from the gloomy past      Til now we stand at last     Where the white gleam of our bright star is cast    God of our weary years     God of our silent tears     Thou who has brought us thus far on the way    Thou who has by Thy might     Led us into the light     Keep us forever in the path  we pray    Lest our feet stray from the places  our God  where we met Thee     Lest  our hearts drunk with the wine of the world  we forget Thee    Shadowed beneath Thy hand     May we forever stand     True to our God     True to our native land   Knowing what inspired these words is essential to truly understanding why this song is so important   Here is a list of recordings of this song that I have found to be helpful  I recommend listening to them in order    Lift Every Voice and Sing     Street Corner Renaissance      Concordia Publishing House      Joslin Grove Choral Society      Women of the Calabash      Beyonce      Bebe Winans      Melinda Doolittle      Temple Praise Band     Performance notes  why I enjoy each recording      Street Corner Renaissance  This is the introductory song of their album  which pays tribute to those who have laid the foundation for these men of color to do what they do today  Their message is of thanks  humility  and reflection    Concordia Publishing House  This is the easiest recording to hear the lyrics as it is clearly articulated and has the lyrics on the screen  I also have a huge soft spot for gospel choirs    Joslin Grove Choral Society  This is slower and allows time to soak in the words that are being sung    Women of the Calabash  The power of these women s voices  and choices of when they use unison and break out into harmony are inspiring    Beyonce  Since I m offering actual points  and not just  YAS KWEEN   I ll say that I appreciate the cultural references within this performance at the 2016 Super Bowl halftime show  as well as her taking her time and putting her modern spin on it while taking off on riffs  This is a condensed version of the first verse    Bebe Winans  The soulful piano introduction made me weep  There is  SO  much emotion in this performance  Bebe s artistic choices like  sing a song  in a downward inflection bring a sense of anguish and assertiveness to the calls of perseverance made within the lyrics    Melinda Doolittle  The piano intro brings a sense of matter of fact solidarity and comfort    Temple Praise Band  This is purely instrumental  which is why I placed it last  so you could gain an understanding of the melody and how the lyrics are shaped and the specific phrasing that Charles Schiermeyer   Matkat Music on YouTube   uses with the Temple Praise Band   It is so important that we take the time to hear the voices of the oppressed and learn about the systems put in place to maintain the status quo of discrimination either from the government directly  or that allowed social discrimination to continue  We can make a change in this world  It is going to be uncomfortable  but until we are all truly equal  we all need to do our part to make it happen,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/hksco9/if_you_dont_know_what_the_black_national_anthem/

history,2020-07-01 18:39:33,Guns  Gas and Grenades  my search for an obscure anecdote ,hjcn4p,18,2,So earlier today  I got a little bored and was reading through a couple of my old books about WW2  And I found this interesting little section in  Iron Fist  Classic Armoured Warfare Case Studies   by Bryan Perrett     In case you can t read it  it describes a gas attack by Japanese troops against British tanks in April of 1942  Two incidents are mentioned  one where a phial is thrown but misses  and one where it is thrown into a Stuart tank   the phial used in these attacks    The whole crew  except for the commander Sgt Campbell  is incapacitated  with Campbell being unscathed as a result of having his head out of the turret during the attack  Campbell then takes back control of the tank  and removes it from the road  before turning it s guns on the site of the ambush  For this action he received a Military Medal   Naturally  this story peaked my interest  It s fairly odd for one thing  gas was nowhere near as used in combat in WW2 as it had been in WW1  and it s fairly well known that one of the reasons no one broke it out on a large scale for combat purposes  against the other major powers  was due to fear of retaliation  It therefore seems odd that Japanese forces would utilise gas grenades only once  and never bother with them again  as surely if you re going that far you might as well keep it up    It s also a bizzare method of disabling a tank  as I m sure many would agree  Thirdly  there are no citations directly  but it is very specific on the details  16th April  Sgt Campbell  Burma  Military Medal  These details are the kind of thing that can be checked  so I wanted to   So now I m interested  It s a odd story  and I want to know more  I get a couple of my history nerd friends to help me out  and we start to dig deeper    First place we find this story replicated  is Tank Tracks to Rangoon  also by Bryan Perrett   It describes the incident again in a little more detail   Same author though  so we can t take it as truth  and it also doesn t give any sources on this incident  We gotta look elsewhere   Next answer  we go hunting through old newspaper archives  since they d include this sort of thing  Unfortunately  I failed to make any progress on this front  No mention of our Mr Campbell    Eventually  we try going for medal records   We get to this site    We try to find it  no dice    We ve almost given up by now  but someone points out a name in Tank Tracks To Rangoon  a Lt John Parry  who was the commander of Sgt Campbell  I plug this name into Google with  Burma  added in a last ditch hope  and while I don t find any accounts written by him  I do find  something else     According to the site it s a list of all recommendations for honours given in the region we re looking for  This seems like our place  So we pop in Campbell  and we get    18 results  Luckily Perrett gave us a fair few details about him so we can sort through them  and we get  Cecil Campbell  a Serjeant in the 7th Hussars who got a Military Medal in 1942  There s also a link to the recommendation  number 0988    This takes us to  here       for those who for whatever reason can t get into that  here s a screenshot     Nothing we didn t know already   but there is an image of the record  If anywhere contains a mention of this incident  it will be the record of the recommendation  Now I could pay  3 50          to access this without a watermark  but I m lazy and poor  so that won t happen  Instead  we re gonna do it the hard way    For those who want to strain their eyes  a link to the image     It s not ideal  But you can just read enough  It says     the enemy attacked with gas grenades  All members of the crew except Sgt Campbell  including the driver  were rendered insensible  Although himself feeling sick and giddy  Sgt Campbell climbed into the driver s seat and drove the tank back 100 yards  Sgt Campbell then manned the gun  and in spite of enemy mortar fire  succeeded with his troop leader in inflicting casualties on parties of the enemy in a building and in the open    So  that s the story confirmed  Despite it seeming fairly outlandish  and despite  as far as I can tell  only one book covering this incident  it was completely true    It s honestly fascinating that this actually occured  and even more so that no one talks about it  Hats off to Perrett for finding it  and thanks must also go to Geoff Sullivan  who is credited with creating the website that allowed me to find his citation  Finally  credit goes to my friends for joining me in such a bizarre search for a small detail in 2 paragraphs of one book,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/hjcn4p/guns_gas_and_grenades_my_search_for_an_obscure/

history,2020-06-30 15:52:19,Part one of historical review  Mediaeval Kingdom Wars  Ireland ,himrsp,5,0,I would like to give the first part of a historical review on the game  Mediaeval Kingdom Wars   specifically looking at Ireland in 1336 in this game  Just to note  this is a historical review  not a gameplay review  I enjoyed the gameplay   First  the background story to the Irish in this game is a little bit wrong  It says in the game  that Ireland  since 10th century was divided into many clans  and  left the Irish ill prepared for the Vikings   This is an error  The first waves of Viking attacks in Ireland happened in 9th century  and by then  Ireland was ruled by dominant kingdoms of Uí Néill and Eóganachta  The annals records the Viking raids as if whole of Ireland was under attack  The coastal monastic settlements  which produced most of the annals  were hit heavily and repeatedly by the Vikings  giving us the impression that the Vikings rampaged through Ireland  However  in reality  whenever the Vikings came inland to the territories of the Uí Néill or Eóganachta  they were crushed immediately  Olaf the White was one of the very few who succeeded in raiding inland  but even he had to face the fierce retaliations from the Uí Néill or Eóganachta   By 10th century  the monastic sites moved more inland and were under protection of the powerful clans such as Uí Néill and Eóganachta  They were still under attack  not by the Vikings but by other Gaelic Kingdoms that were pushing their monasteries to be more dominant  On the other hand  the Vikings settled  married  and fostered children in Ireland  assimilating into Irish society and establishing Hiberno Scandinavian settlements on the coast  The dynasties that emerged from the Hiberno Scandinavian establishment  such as Uí Ímair  were no longer seen as a part of the original Vikings  but rather like just another clan  So to say that Irish left themselves open to a  Viking conquest  because they were too busy fighting with each other  is greatly misleading  the Gaelic clans were busy fighting each other  but the Vikings joined the party and kept on fighting in a mediaeval feudal world   The reason I highlight this is simple because many people  not only this game  have this perception of what Ireland was like in the Viking age,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/himrsp/part_one_of_historical_review_mediaeval_kingdom/

history,2020-06-26 20:26:50,The American revolution was one of the most hypocritical and overrated revolutions in history  despite it s accomplishments ,hgbwuf,35,98,So I do believe that the American founding fathers had some great accomplishments  But I believe that the American revolution was an overrated revolution filled with a lot of hypocrisy  These are the reasons     i The question of colonialism and Native Americans    The American revolution is often times portrayed as an anticolonial revolution because of the rebellion against the British Empire  But what was one of the reasons that the people in the thirteen colonies rebelled  The Declaration of 1763     The British crown had placed limits on how much land settlers from the Thirteen colonies could settle on  The 1763 was a land mark ruling in terms of the treaty rights for Native Americans and indigenous people  This frustrated the settlers from the 13 colonies  So when they revolted they weren t launching an anti colonial revolt  It was a bunch of colonists launching an anti imperial revolt in defense of colonialism     ii The question of religious freedom and Catholics    The American revolution is depicted a lot as this revolutionary movement that valued the defense of freedom of religion  And yet one of the groups denied rights were Catholics  In fact one of the reasons the colonists revolted was they were against granting rights to Catholics     After the 7 years war when New France was conquered by British North America the province of Quebec was created to give rights to French Catholics  This angered the largely Protestant and Enlightenment based colonists     iii The question of slavery     This one s the most obvious  A group of plantation owners demanding freedom while owning slaves  But the criticism could actually go deeper than this     Slavery was abolished in the British Empire in 1833  It was abolished in the United States in 1865  So one could argue from the perspective of black slaves that for the sake of freedom it was actually important the American revolution fail given the events of history  and given the fact that the British were actually promising slaves that fought for them their freedom     iv The question of freedom and democracy     This one that kinda shows its overratedness to me  The American revolution styled itself as a defense of democracy  And yet  it s not as if the Americans were rebelling or overthrowing a dictatorship  Sure  there was taxation without representation  But the British system had a constitutional monarchy with democratic governance    In Britain itself you had an elected parliament with MPs and a PM  In the Thirteen colonies you had an elected state legislature with an elected governor  British were ironically the ones who gave the Americans their understanding of democracy and freedom  And when you look at a country like Canada which remained with the British it didn t turn into some dictatorship  It turned into a democracy as well    There are many more things I could list but these reasons make the American revolution seem highly overrated to me  This isn t to say there aren t accomplishments  Building a new nation is itself an accomplishment  But the reasons for the American revolution make it seem highly overrated to me,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/hgbwuf/the_american_revolution_was_one_of_the_most/

history,2020-06-04 22:09:48,Kosovo  as William Dorich wrote in his 1992 book   Kosovo ,gwnxnn,4,1, quote   Kosovo permanently changed the face of Europe and altered history  Kosovo  100 years before Columbus sailed for the New World  was a statement for religious freedom and the belief that no man had a right to rule another  Rather than to consent to become slaves to tyranny  the Serbs willingly gave their lives for their religious belief  Seldom in history have we witnessed such a commitment  The Serbs on the Kosovo Field not only paid with the staggering loss of 77 000 lives in one day of battle  but the Serbian nation suffered 500 years of Ottoman slavery as the consequence  Historians have never spoken of Kosovo as though it were an event in the past that will never happen again  Through the centuries  Serbian sacrifice and Kosovo have become synonymous   The Serbian people have continually assumed that in every century they would again find it necessary to defend their rights to their land  self determination  and freedom of worship  History in the Balkans continuously repeats itself  In 1690  more than 180 000 Serbs were forced from Kosovo and  again  an equal number were exiled in 1737  After the Congress of Berlin  in 1878  another 150 000 Serbs were expelled  This ongoing trend took on tragic proportions following the war in Crete between Turkey and Greece in 1897  Diplomatic efforts to stem the tide of atrocities against Serbs were useless  but documentation remains to testify to the crimes committed against the Serbian population  The Balkan war of 1912 was fought not only by Serbs but by Montenegrins  Bulgarians  and Greeks to liberate their people from centuries of uninterrupted Islamic aggression  The situation is little changed today   To understand Kosovo  the American people need to compare the current Balkan crisis with its own American Civil War in which just 4  of the population lost their lives compared to Serbia who lost 52  of her adult male population in WWI and another 26  of her overall population in WWII  Readers of this forum need reminding that during the American Civil War it was the loyal Virginia citizens who refused to secede from the union and formed the state of West Virginia in 1863  Certainly  Serbs deserve the same rights to remain in their union  a union which was internationally recognized as a nation in 1878 at the Congress of Berlin   Not a single head of state  nor any American president  senator  or humanitarian group raised their voices as 200 000 Serbs were  ethnically cleansed  from Kosovo in the last 2 decades  People should be asking  why are the Serbs destined to suffer and be persecuted   end quote ,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/gwnxnn/kosovo_as_william_dorich_wrote_in_his_1992_book/

history,2020-06-04 19:10:04,In African American history Elijah Muhammad is a complex and underrated historical figure  And his relationship with Malcolm X is more complicated than people think ,gwkewe,1,5,Elijah Muhammad was the prophet and leader of the Nation of Islam  a black nationalist spiritual movement that came to prominence in America in the 1950s and 60s  He is known for his idiosyncratic and heterodox interpretation of Islam  teaching that the black man was a  god  and those who were white were  devils  as well as his call for black separatism and independence  The nation at this time emphasized black pride and played a major role in rehabilitating black men who were either convicts or on the streets into family men and entrepreneurs that built black own businesses and newspapers and cultural institutions    Why do I think he is underrated  Everyone knows Malcolm X and Muhammad Ali  And everyone knows about the black panthers and black power movement  What isn t spoken of as much is that  as strange and reactionary  as some of Muhammad s thought was  he was the spiritual father and mentor of these prominent movements and leaders  Malcolm X s identity as a leader was formed by Elijah Muhammad  Elijah Muhammad assigned the moniker  X  to him  symbolising giving up his slave name and Muhammad gave him a purpose to live after his incarceration  It was even Muhammad who allowed Alex Haley to begin the famous Autobiography of Malcolm X  one of the most influential pieces of literature in African American literature  It was also Elijah Muhammad who bestowed on Muhammad Ali his name  And even Ali s famous activism against the Vietnam War  Ali was inspired to do that by Muhammad s own refusal to join the draft in WWII  Beyond members of the nation  in the Black Panther Party leaders like Huey Newton modelled their organization of the Nation of Islam and even thought of joining  Stokely Carmichael  who coined the phrase  black power  also saw Elijah Muhammad as a mentor    He is also known for his famous split with Malcolm X  when Malcolm converted to Orthodox Islam  What isn t as understood is that the split is more complex than depicted  It wasn t just about Malcolm waking up to the strange aspects of Muhammad s theology or some of the controversial scandals surrounding Muhammad  It was also an ideological split in black nationalism  Elijah Muhammad was what is called a   cultural nationalist   while Malcolm was a   revolutionary nationalist    What was the difference  The first difference was that cultural nationalism had a conservative approach to black nationalism  Revolutionary nationalism was by it s name  revolutionary  The second difference had to do with political activism  Revolutionary nationalists believe in political activism and protest politics  Cultural nationalists do not  They see politics in a fatalistic manner  believing that the white power structure can never change  Because of this they view politics as a distraction and see what is most important to the black nationalist cause as culture and economics  Black culture in the sense of promoting a theology of black nationalism  black pride and black economic institutions  The goal of cultural nationalists wasn t to change the system but build an alternate system for blacks while leaving the old order intact  So Muhammad had an a political approach to black nationalism while Malcolm had a very political approach    But the biggest and most ironic split between the two is the role of violence  Malcolm X is very famous for his advocacy of militant self defense for blacks and revolutionary violence to change oppressive power structures  In the discussions about violence during the civil rights movement Malcolm s stance is often contrasted with MLK s  What people don t know is that it also contrasted with Elijah Muhammad  his teach  Muhammad ironically enough  even though he led an organization of black militants  and had one of the most powerful black militant security forces the F O I  he did not believe in violence  When Malcolm suggested that the Nation arm the F O I Elijah forbade it  In 1962 when the police attacked a group of Nation of Islam worshippers  Malcolm wanted to retaliate  Elijah forbade it and settled the case in court peacefully  In fact during the aftermath of Malcolm s assassination Elijah made a point of critique what he saw as Malcolm s  violent teaching   So even though he was a black nationalist  a black seperatist and the prophet to many black militants  his philosophy on violence was ironically closer to Martin Luther King s than it was to his own students  So Elijah Muhammad is an underrated and complex historical figure in the black american community,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/gwkewe/in_african_american_history_elijah_muhammad_is_a/
