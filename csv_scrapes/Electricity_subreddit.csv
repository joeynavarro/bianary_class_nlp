Electricity,2020-05-16 02:34:57,I don t understand solar panels,gkk4go,3,1,I thought I did  but there was still some more clarification needed  Then I watched another  more precise video  and now I m even more confused    So  I ll explain how I understand the process to be  and then pinpoint where the confusion comes in   First we ve got two types of silicon  N type and P type  doped with phosphorus and boron  since they have one more and one less valence electron respectively  This creates a charge between the N type and P type  as the former will have an abundance of electrons  and the latter will have lack of electrons  electron holes   When these two types meet  a surge of electrons from the N type to the P type will happen  but not on a  global  scale  With that I mean electrons from every corner of the N type won t migrate over  Instead  there ll be an area surrounding the border of the N type and P type  called an N P junction  Inside this area  an equilibrium will be achieved  Whenever electrons inside the area jump into the P type side to fill an electron hole  an electron will fill the hole the electron left in it s wake  these replacing electrons being supplemented by the N type side    Exactly how big this area is is probably dictated by a or multiple coefficient s   Anyways  my question is  how does this configuration lead to an unidirectional current leading electrons out of the solar panel  into the consumers  and then back to the solar panel  I know there are conductors on either side of the silicon  but why does the electrons on the top N type decide to move into the conducting metal grid above  It seems counter intuitive to me as surely the charge would pull the electrons downwards towards the P type  where the electron holes are  This was explained away by the fact of the N P junction  acting as a barrier  But how it acts as a barrier is what I don t understand    The last video I watched also said that the N type would become positively charged and the P type negatively charged  though I presume the video was referring to the area right outside of the junction   But then the video illustrated the arrows going from positive to negative  as if the electrons were moving that way  which doesn t make sense  unless they re talking about conventional flow  but surely this isn t the correct context for that      So  yeah  I m quite confused  Either I misunderstood something  missed a piece of info or both  Here s the video that made me the most confused      These two videos also contributed to my understanding of the subject            ,https://www.reddit.com/r/Electricity/comments/gkk4go/i_dont_understand_solar_panels/

Electricity,2020-05-03 18:06:59,Need some assistance with power conditioning for devices that seem to be interfering with each other ,gcs43j,1,7,Hi      I m sorry if this is the wrong place to post this  I swear it s about power conditioning  eventually       I m on an avocado farm in a rural area  I m using Ubiquiti Loco M2s to link my house to the main store shed  where I have a bunch of IP cameras  They work real good        Now  recently  I decided to get some pigs in  I ve got an area sectioned off for them using polywire electric fencing  driven by a solar energizer  Now  because that s more valuable than the pigs are  I want to hang an extra camera  ostensibly to watch the pigs  but really to watch the energizer  Blah blah long story short  the only way to do this is to split power off from the Loco M2  It really is        Now  the M2 gets 12VDC via passive POE from the shed  I ve hung an extra box on the pole where it is  and the idea is  use a passive POE splitter to bring power out of that network cable  Then I split that 3 ways to juice 1  the M2 again  2  a small network switch  and 3  the new IP camera  The switch is necessary because there are now 2 network devices on the end of this cable  where there used to be 1  Actually 3 if you count the switch itself  And because I want to use a wemos D1 to monitor the level in the reservoir 1m away  that switch is actually a wireless AP       All of those devices run 12VDC  so  theoretically  I just need to make sure there s enough amps and voltage at the end of the line        I started at the power supply in the shed  and made sure that the M2 s line was now fused for 3A  used to be 1   The M2 draws about 300ma  the WAP about 500ma  and the camera 1A  for a total of 1 8A 12V  so I figured 3A should more than cover it       Fastforward  it s all installed  but the camera doesn t work  Test power at the camera  and the length of ethernet run has reduced the voltage to 10 4V  Bugger  Headed back to the workshop  and soldered some plugs onto a boost converter  Installed it where the power splits 3 ways onto the camera line  Hooray  it s all working       Except it s not  The WAP keeps rebooting  and the M2 won t boot at all  and is making a Bad Sound  like what an old school camera flash sounds like when it charges  If I disconnect the WAP  the bad sound stops  I can t disconnect the boost converter  because then the camera won t work       So I have two choices  as I see it  One occurred to me as I typed this   I could move the boost converter to the camera pole itself  I d need to build an enclosure for it  but  yeah  I could do that  But I m not sure that would solve it       The other is be more smart about how I split the 12V 3 ways  I think I need to build some sort of filter to decouple the devices  it s like they re interfering with each other  I m handy with a soldering iron  but I m not clever  Would it be enough to just put a capacitor over the power at each 12V jack  And if so  what size       Thanks,https://www.reddit.com/r/Electricity/comments/gcs43j/need_some_assistance_with_power_conditioning_for/

Electricity,2020-04-17 12:39:46,Current Same In series Circuit,g2ytus,2,7,Hey guys this might seem like a very stupid question but I am very confused and never seem to understand the basics of electricity   According to my textbook current is the rate of flow of charge it is directly proportional to voltage rovided the resistance remains constant  So  when current which is basically electrons carrying electrical energy when they pass through a resistor or lamp or any other electrical component some of the electrical energy gets converted into thermal energy so the electrical energy they carry is reduced right  And as they pass through a component they undergo collisions with the atoms which causes their speed to reduce they will travel slower and therefore pass through the resistor much slowly so as its speed reduces the current should reduce   As current is the rate of charge it s rate will definitely reduce due to the collisions it will go through right  I understand that the  amount of electrons will remain same as everyone says but current just isn t  flowing electrons  it s the rate at which they flow so although the amount of electrons flowing remains same their rate of flow decreases so isn t the current supposed to be reduced rather than remain constant  I could be totally wrong but I haven t found any resource which gives me the answer to my question everyone claims the amount of electron remains same  I agree  but no one refers to its rate I am studying this entire chapter by myself so sorry if something I said tends to be wrong,https://www.reddit.com/r/Electricity/comments/g2ytus/current_same_in_series_circuit/

Electricity,2020-04-04 04:13:41,Can using an ungrounded outlet fry my laptop charger that has a grounding prong on the plug ,fukmfk,2,2,Full story I have a Macbook Pro from 2015  and the part of the charger cable that attaches to the laptop was getting frayed and ugly for a while  and it finally stopped working this year  I figured it was from physical wear and tear on the cable  so I got another  original  one from a friend  It worked for a few weeks  but then stopped working suddenly  It s in perfect condition phsycially  so I m trying to figure out what the problem could be   Both chargers have a 3 prong plug  and if you are familiar with Macbook chargers they are ones where the cable with the plug on it actually has metal that makes a connection to the power block s grounding pin  I ve been primarily using both chargers with an extension cord that fits the 3 prongplug  but upon inspecting the extension cord  the holes for the third prong seem to be just plastic inside  By my logic the grounding prong isn t actually connecting to anything  Can that be ruining my chargers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Electricity/comments/fukmfk/can_using_an_ungrounded_outlet_fry_my_laptop/

Electricity,2020-03-10 02:41:53,How Low Can Coal Go ,fg4bs4,5,0,Coal experienced new all time lows this last week   New Hourly Low  MW   On March 7th at 7 PM Eastern Time the US coal fleet generation dipped to 50 817 MW   New Hourly Low    of total system load   On March 7th at 7 PM Eastern Time the US coal fleet generation covered 13 6  of total system generation  This means 86 4  of Keeping the Lights On was being done by non Coal generation   In this same hour 31  of system load was being covered by renewables   New Daily Total Low  TWh   Yesterday  March 8th  daily total US coal generation was 1 385 TWh  All of these lows will be tested and bested in the days between now and the end of May  A combination of seasonally higher wind speeds  more sunshine  melting snow packs  low gas prices and below normal load conditions are hammering coal use   Total coal generation year to date is down 33  from 2019  At this time last year coal generation had just reached 200 TWh  As of the end of day March 8th we re only at 133 TWh  Three factors have contributed to this 66 TWh drop in coal use  1  A 23 TWh drop in load  2  A 33 TWh increase in gas  3  A 16 TWh increase in RE  All the other resources in the EIA 930 data set are holding steady except nuclear generation which is down 5 TWh from last year   Things are likely to get much worse   Part 1  Load  The 4  drop in load that we ve seen so far this year relative to 2019 is primarily due to a mild winter  Some would argue it s still too early to tell but it appears the US economy is headed into a recession  The last recession pushed total electricity demand down by 4  over the course of 2009 so we can use 4  as a place holder guess for how much a recession reduces annual load  I d argue a 2020 recession would exceed 4  by around  5 to 1 percent because this additional reduction is already baked into the 2020 projection based on the mild winter we re having  The wildcard factor in all of this is how much electricity use will be curbed by an extended lockdown due to the COVID outbreak   A few months of reduced load  23 TWh less load  is far different from a full year s worth of reduced load that could add up to 200 TWh or more   Things are likely to get much worse   Part 2  Natural Gas  Natural gas is up by 15  year to date compared to last year  This represents an extra  5 TWh a day of additional gas fired generation  If gas continues at this pace it means we ll see 365 x  5   180 TWh of additional gas generation in 2020 vs  2019  The performance of gas year to date is all the more remarkable considering we re in the heating season   If the economy dips we d expect less oil and gas production but we d also expect less industrial activity and less LNG exports  Even with reduced gas production in 2020 it could end up that there s still more gas available to the power sector in 2020 than there was in 2019  Jude Clemente casually suggested gas could be  47 to 52  of summer generation   based on the way things are going  Needless to say  gas will be interesting to watch over the next couple of months  Things are likely to get much worse   Part 3  Wind and Solar  The wind and solar projects completed in 2019 and 2020 are expected to bring 75 to 100 TWh of additional new RE generation online in 2020   The Perfect Storm   Load   Gas   RE  Load   A drop of 200 TWh  Natural Gas   An increase of 200 TWh  Wind   Solar   An increase of 100 TWh  You know what they say in plumbing 101   The goes insies have to equal the goes outsies   Coal in 2020   Coal in 2019   500 TWh   450 TWh  Coal is currently trending 33  below where it was in 2019  This perfect storm scenario represents an annual drop of 53    Year to Year Generation in a Perfect Storm Scenario   2019 to 2020  Coal 941 to 455 TWh  Gas 1424 to 1652 TWh  Oil 33 to 33 TWh  Nuclear 841 o 837 TWh  Hydro 291 to 292 TWh  Wind 294 to 338 TWh  Solar 64 to 88 TWh  Other 72 TWh to 72 TWh  Load 3960 to 3762 TWh  this is a roughly a 5  decline in load   Note  These numbers don t net out 100   This calculation isn t a simple Back of the Envelope calculation but it s hardly rigorous  The Hydro  Oil  Nuclear and Other calculations are based on persistence   i e  The first two months of known data are added to last years totals  for the rest of the year  The solar and wind data are based on the average capacity factors reported by the EIA from 2017 to 2019 multiplied by the expected capacity per month over the course of 2020  with one month of lag   These wind and solar numbers are prorated up slightly to account for lagging reporting in the 930 data  The load data is last year s load for January and February plus 95  of the load for March through December  All of these calculations assume Coal is the resource which will be cut first   The Rebound Effect  One could argue  maybe coal has a bad year in 2020 but that doesn t mean it s permanent  I suppose that s true but you ve got to figure a 53  drop in coal generation due to a hypothetical 2020 recession is a lot different than the 12  drop in coal generation we saw in the last recession  A 12  drop is a flesh wound  A 53  drop will prove to be a mortal injury for many coal plants around the US which are already suffering from reduced operating hours   Deadpool        A good way to rank the likelihood of a coal plant retiring is to look at how often the plant is operated   i e  the capacity factor  This is a list of US coal plants listed  from lowest to highest  in order of capacity factors in 2019  This is the bottom 150  Note that you could eliminate all of these plants  72 GW of capacity  and it would only cut around 200 TWh of coal generation         This is a preliminary analysis that only covers around 70  of the coal plants in the US         Plants with retirement and or deactivation dates have been filtered from this list        Plants with retirement and or deactivation dates generated approximately 100 TWh in 2019     x200B       x200B ,https://www.reddit.com/r/Electricity/comments/fg4bs4/how_low_can_coal_go/

Electricity,2020-01-10 08:54:17,How does a voltage drop cause increased current ,emncaz,1,3,I ve been reading up on why you should not use long extension cords to power pumps  e g   sump pumps  that draw a good bit of current  say 10A  due to VOLTAGE DROP   The vast majority of sources say that the voltage drop over the line can cause the pump to draw HIGHER CURRENT  which can cause heating  and can burn up the motor   This intuitively did not make sense to me based on my college physics 2 class  so I did some digging     I found this one specifically about voltage drops and how to measure them         It seems to agree with what I believe  that if you add extra resistance to the line  e g   using a long extension cord   then the current that flows through wire is significantly reduced   He basically takes a 12V 1A bulb and precedes it  in series  with about 1200 Ohms of resistance   This caused the bulb not to turn on because  as he measured  only 10 mA were running through the line    12V 1200Ohms   10 mAs      If you overlay this with my sump pump example  if you connect a 110V 10A sump pump to a 110V outlet via a 100ft extensions cord  which is going to increase resistance   then it s just not going to draw 10A and run properly      What would possibly make it draw more than 10A,https://www.reddit.com/r/Electricity/comments/emncaz/how_does_a_voltage_drop_cause_increased_current/

Electricity,2019-12-04 05:41:40,Failing outlets  power strip restrictions  and rapid battery capacity drains,e5t843,0,8,Hey  I have a couple problems I m wondering about    any suggestions for how to resolve or at least understand are appreciated  I am not an electrician or literate in the field  so pardon the lack of vocabulary   Preface  I ll preface this with something that could be important  the government military has been conducting testing that involves manipulation of the electromagnetic frequencies  I live in an apartment  and anything from the plumbing to appliances have been used or effected by these shifts   Some seem to be coming from elsewhere  Some seems like it probably comes from a cell tower right across the street  Both extremely low frequencies and higher levels  like microwaves are being emitted  both of those levels seem to be the favorites to tinker around with  It s caused significant disruptions in my life and with my health  but I m not here to complain about that    but you can ask me questions privately if you need to know more   I am writing just for a few simple questions  Questions  1  I am routinely failing outlets where they will just stop working  even after pressing the reset button on the outlet   I ve gone to the circuit breaker  turned it off for varying amounts of time  then back on  and nothing resolves  I m not overloading the outlets or anything like that  and it s always the same outlets that fail  I ve had maintenance come fix outlets  and every time I ask why this keeps happening  they either ignore me or act like they don t know what I m talking about  I m from California  where certain occupations like maintenance workers tend to be from Mexico  Or Central South America and in these particular  circumstances  with the many issues I ve experienced inside my apartment  I ve noticed that certain questions involve workers conveniently  not understanding  due to English not being their first language  Sorry if that sounds totally racist  I m just saying that this is unique to my current situation  and I don t generalize all ESL people are like that   Any idea what could be occurring and how I can prevent it or fix it myself  I have grown to hate the idea of having these maintenance guys in my apartment   2  I have limited outlets in my apartment and often need to use power strips   I have a portable heater which I don t use with extension cords because they ll melt  but I will use with power strips   Until two days ago  I ve had no issues with this but suddenly  when I use my heater with a power strip  and even if the heater is the only thing plugged into the power strip it will work for a few seconds  and then turn off  and I ll have to press reset on the power strip  and turn the heater back on  It happens every minute or so  which has made it so that I can not use power strips and my heater anymore again    anyone know why this is happening and how to prevent or resolve   3  As I mentioned above EMF fields are being manipulated and it s pretty much around he clock  with certain levels occurring more during certain time frames  I think this is what s cause d considerable damage to nearly every single electronic device I ve owned    Literally  everything  Anything that uses battery it has a portable battery installed in it either suddenly stopped working one day  or will drain the battery many times faster  Example  I just had a refurbished cell phone that had 99  battery capacity in the first month  then  one day suddenly got very hot  and then battery capacity declined 2 3  each day  THE battery died more and mor quickly and soon couldn t operate without being plugged in 24 7 Apple says to replace the battery at 80   The phone stopped working completely before I could even do that  I m currently without a phone  and now my iPad is experiencing the same thing  Hot battery without being plugged in  and a rapid decline in battery power     Example 2  Things that used to last months will now last weeks  or less   What s suspect is that items in which I ve had multiple of    for example  I had six portable battery operated nail files  they were going to be gifts   I had used them with no issues  and suddenly I come home one day  and none of them work  even with brand new batteries  I could easily understand one randomly stop working  but for all six to stop working in the same day after I d just used them one or two days prior says somethings up   Any ideas what could be happening  Would microwaves cause this  Help me understand  prevent  and resolve if possible         Given the fact that I ve stated the government being behind this program  and due to my own past experience of publicizing my awareness of these activities which are occurring in every state in the US and beyond I m prepared for some contrarians to chime in and try to squash this as if I m some paranoid nut  Go right ahead if that s what suits you or pays you   but I will not engage with you,https://www.reddit.com/r/Electricity/comments/e5t843/failing_outlets_power_strip_restrictions_and/
Electricity,2019-12-03 09:31:20,Solar PV has been making my meter go backwards ,e5dl2y,3,11,UK here with a somewhat strange issue   I had solar PV panels installed in 2012  At the time I had 2 kids growing up   was running my business from home  so electricity usage appeared to be fairly consistent   Over the ensuing years the living circumstances have changed   went to only 1 child at home  then moved the the business out for a few years  then  went from electrical central heating to gas  2nd child moved out  then business moved back in   went part time  so electricity usage has varied  and more recently dropped significantly   I gave my supplier a reading in February  they ve only been really pushing smart meters this last year    have managed to balls up 2 installation dates by cancelling or not turning up so far   then over the following months noticed that my credit had built to over  300  so phoned to ask for a refund 2 months ago   I gave a current meter reading    after asking me to confirm it again  the service rep  said my reading was lower than in February  She then noticed I have solar PV   concluded it must be causing my meter to run in reverse  so said an engineer would need to visit to investigate   So far they ve not been in touch   I m going to get in touch with them again today  but was wondering if anyone else has come across this before  and if the supplier is likely to whack me with a huge charge  as they ve likely been subsidising my supply for 7  years,https://www.reddit.com/r/Electricity/comments/e5dl2y/solar_pv_has_been_making_my_meter_go_backwards/

Electricity,2019-09-23 23:40:49,Question  Could I have died ,d8ck9h,6,18,This has been bothering me a lot lately  About 6 years ago my dad installed a motion sensor in the bathroom which turned on the fan and the lights because he felt like it would save energy as we wouldn t leave the lights on or something  not that we did leave the lights on but that s neither here nor there  Every night my brother would go into the bathroom in the middle of the night  to drink water  which would turn the bathroom fan on for about 10 minutes  and sometimes he d go in there a second time  This frustrated me greatly  because during those 10 minutes I couldn t fall asleep due to the fan s noise  So at one night I was so frustrated I went into the bathroom to see if I could fiddle with the timer so that it would turn off after 30 seconds or something  There were some dial things you could turn and stuff so it seemed like you could edit the timer  which was installed on the ceiling  I don t remember how or why but at some point the circuit board got exposed  I touched it and I received an electric shock  I don t really remember how intense or painful it was  but I don t think I yelled or said ouch or anything  I just so happened to wear rubber slippers at the moment  for no reason I can recall other than that it was wet  but usually I don t care about that  I must ve put them on in a random act of randomness  this is what has been fucking with me lately  I went back to sleep a little befuddled and the next morning I told my dad the story  he said I could ve died  and after that statement both my parents casually went back to reading the news paper as if dad didn t just drop a massive bombshell  So that fucked with me then  but only for a day or two and I sort of forgot about it  however lately this memory has been creeping up again and I keep thinking about the fact I could ve died  it s really chilling and I would like some reassurance  I haven t gotten it so far from people whom I ve told the story to  but I don t think they re experts on electricity  my dad does know a thing or two about it but he can be a bit dramatic autistic  or whatever  So was my dad right  Could I have died had I not worn rubber slippers for no reason  I live in Europe so I believe the voltage is different here than in the US  otherwise I don t know anything about electricity  Another point of possible relevance  our bathroom has a heated floor  and I think the tiles are made of some kind of metal to conduct the heat  I m not sure though  and the floor was definitely wet that night,https://www.reddit.com/r/Electricity/comments/d8ck9h/question_could_i_have_died/
Electricity,2019-09-23 15:54:42,Laptop charger causing trouble,d86582,2,7,Hello everyone   Recently I moved into a new apartment for college and of course I brought my laptop with me  Everything worked fine for a while and the laptop charged without any issues  However  then I realized that sometimes while charging my charger started making weird ticking noises which it did not make before  The noise is like a periodic tick  After a while of  charging it goes away though so I didn t think much of it at first   Yesterday I noticed that every time the noises start my router mysteriously restarts and starts flickering a lot which got me concerned  Today i went to plug in my laptop and in the morning everything was fine  I got 2 full charges  done without any ticking or any issues whatsoever  Then at around 1 afternoon I plugged in my charger again and the ticking started again  My router freaked out as well   I went to my electricity box  not sure what they re called in english  the one with switches that control electricity in the apartmet and a light to indicate that electricity is flowing  and I noticed that the light there is flickering as well and that it s ticking too  I quickly unplugged my charger and the ticking stopped  I tried it in another plug in another room but it did the same  I then tried plugging it in again and suddenly the light of the electric box shut off completely and I had no electricity  I played around with the switches a bit having no idea what they do  I wanted to call the apartment owner but then the electricity came back  I got really worried and scared   So I guess my charger is overloading the electric flow and causing it to be stopped so it doesn t cause damage to any electric utilities  The ticking was from it turning on and off constantly as the flow of electricity was only being interupted shortly  This is just what I think though     But why did it not happen sometimes at all  I had no problems this morning  I m scared of plugging in my laptop now   The laptop is an HP EliteBook Folio 9470m notebook   According to the label it uses an input of 19 5 V and 2 31 A  The battery is the original battery BT0 4XL and it says 14 8 V    52 Wh  not sure what that represents   I believe here is the crucial part  the charger is a replacement charger and not the original as the original stopped working a while ago  It s a replacement AC adapter model YH   1947H with an output of 19 V and 4 74 A  Could it be that the high amps are causing trouble since they don t match fully with my laptop  But my laptop doesn t show any signs of damage  or anything  The previous charger was 18 5 V and 3 5 A if I remember correctly  I m honestly not sure if that charger was the original one since i got the laptop and charger from a cousin  I never had any trouble like this with this charger at my home and I ve been using this charger for 2 3 months now   I m posting this here instead of in computers because there s no computer and laptop related damage  just my charger causing my electricity flow to stop   Could it be that the polarity isn t correct  The charger polarity has an open circle towards    Does it matter which way I plug it in  I m too scared to test it because I don t want to cause any damage or be left without electricity  I can t find polarity listed on the laptop   Oh and I live in Europe in case that matters     Please help me if you can I m actually kinda scared since I dont know much about electricity and all that     EDIT   The box is called a circuit breaker apparently and it was tripping repeatedly  lol     EDIT 2   Tripping probably isn t the right term since non of the switches turned off  the light just flickered a lot and so did my router lights   EDIT 3   I just looked at the circuit breaker s   There are 9 of them  The last two have 16 A and all others have 10 A  Don t know how circuits work or anything but as my fridge just turned on the light in my room turned off for a split second and so did the circuit breaker box light     EDIT 4   Okay so I though about it and I think that since my charger is using up to 4 74 A it is in fact overloading the circuit  but it s not using that ammount always    So when the charging load is at it s highest it overloads the circuit and when not then it uses less amps and doesn t  Does that make sense   EDIT 5   The breakers weren t tripping  read my reply bellow  Sorry for the confusion,https://www.reddit.com/r/Electricity/comments/d86582/laptop_charger_causing_trouble/
Electricity,2019-09-18 20:02:56,Advice on solenoid strength,d60r23,1,2,   Hello subreddit   I am attempting to build a sort of solenoid  The idea is to attach springy membranes to the ends of the pipe and eventually achieve a sort of oscillation  with the solenoid drawing current to pull the steel bolt in the middle  then stopping current flow and letting inertia carry the bolt to the other side  where it will bounce off again and travel back to the other side   I plan to achieve the oscillation either with a hall effect sensor  or a 555 timer adjusted to fire in astable mode at the correct moment to make the bold move back and forth between the membranes   Currently  the issue I am facing is that the solenoid is just too weak  I have about 300 turns of magnet wire here  0 3240 mm²  22 AWG   I just thought I d wing it and it should be enough  but apparently it isn t  Even when I push close to 5A of current through it  the force is barely enough to hold the bolt if it enters the pipe with some velocity  At 3A it can t even overcome gravity   I am looking for some advice on how to create a strong enough force for this  Obviously more wire turns would eventually do the trick  but I would like to avoid that  I could make the bolt lighter and reduce friction inside the pipe  but I fear that this will take away from the  oomph  of the bolt hitting the membranes   Maybe generating a very high current pulse with a flash capacitor could work   Any tips are appreciated  Maybe someone can even show me the way with the proper math,https://www.reddit.com/r/Electricity/comments/d60r23/advice_on_solenoid_strength/

Electricity,2019-09-05 21:21:41,How do Amps  Volts and Watts affect circuits ,d04mc4,6,13,I ve been reading about electricity and these units to better understand circuits and build my own without issues  I m trying to build a LED panel but the explanations I m reading don t really explain how these quantities affect real life circuits     Voltage is the  pressure    Current  Ampere  is the flow    Power  Watts  are the resulting power  Volt x Amps    Resistance is the   resistance of a circuit and controls pressure     Every LED diode needs the right amount of pressure  and if you feed it more Volts  you ll fry the diodes  One diode needs 0 04V to achieve full power  and 300 diodes demand 12Volts  If you feed less Volts  the LEDs will not operate at full power and will emit less light     I m a lot more confused with the current  From what I m reading  you won t damage a circuit  and the diodes  by feeding them more Amps  but they demand a specific current to work   right  The LED vendor recommends using a   12V 6A adapter    but how many Amps do I need to make them work at full potential  People are saying that   3A   will be enough  but I m only getting more doubtful after all these different tips     The resulting power is   Volts x Amps   Watts    The more watts I get  the brighter the diodes will be  Hence  the more amps you feed  the more light will be emitted   right  Since I can t feed more than   12V    I m looking to feed as many amps   what do you think    Most texts explaining these values quantities  will also include resistance  Resistance is the value that controls pressure  voltage   but nor the LED strips or the power adapters tell how many Ohms take part in the equation  The LED diodes will play the role of resistors  and from the equation R Voltage Current  the resistance will be   0 5Ohms for a 12V 6A adapter    I don t know if resistance is important in such an instance    ________________________________________________________________    Please  help me understand which is the best combination that guarantees full brightness and maximum LED longevity  I will most probably be using a 10V power adapter to lengthen the life of the LED strips and not have any overheating problems     ,https://www.reddit.com/r/Electricity/comments/d04mc4/how_do_amps_volts_and_watts_affect_circuits/

Electricity,2019-09-05 12:29:44,Saving Power,czyhgn,1,9,     Tips to make your house energy efficient     An average household uses 3 000 kilowatt hours of electricity annually  For   0 24 per kWh  this ensures an annual electricity bill of  720  By using energy efficiently  you can give the climate a helping hand and you can lower your energy bill  HERE list ten tips for you to save on electricity     1 Replace light bulbs for LED lamps  save up to  145 Dollars per year      Lighting is the largest power consumer in many houses  Replace all light bulbs in the house for energy efficient LED lights and save tens of Dollars on electricity per year  Moreover  do not leave the lights on unnecessarily  even if you have efficient lights     2  Wash at lower temperatures  save  19 Dollars per year      Washing at 30 degrees is half cheaper than at 60 degrees and a quarter cheaper than at 40 degrees  The washing machine uses the most energy for heating the water  Colder washing saves a lot of electricity  To get dirty laundry well cleaned at a lower temperature  you have to wash longer  That is why a wash on the eco mode often takes longer than a regular program  Also use the eco mode of other devices  such as the computer and the dishwasher     3 Replace your floor heating pump  save up to  112 Dollars per year      The underfloor heating pump pumps the hot water around the house  Most Dutch people with underfloor heating have an old pump that only has one position  These pumps are on at full capacity all year round  even when the heating is not on  There are now floor heating pumps on the market that work much more efficiently than older models  Instead of paying  145  you only pay  22 a year in electricity  Do you not want to replace your pump  Then see if you can put it on the lowest setting and completely off in the summer months     4  Use a clothesline or drying rack  save up to  98 Dollars per year      An average tumble dryer consumes almost a euro in electricity every time it is switched on  Calculate what that costs in a whole year  Every time you use a clothesline or drying rack  you earn money  Can you not do it without your dryer  Then choose a heat pump dryer with the best possible energy rating     5  Replace your old fridge  save up to  45 Dollars per year      Most people only replace electrical devices when they are broken  but it is much more climate friendly and in many cases also cheaper to do that earlier  In addition to your fridge  also look for example at your washing machine  freezer  tumble dryer and television  Many electrical appliances now consume half as much electricity as the same equipment a few years ago     6  Replace your ventilation box  save up to  70 Dollars per year      Of the 2 4 million households with mechanical ventilation  95 percent still have an old  alternating current  ventilation box  This box uses more than   89 a year in electricity  That is more than the washing machine and the fridge put together  Modern boxes  with the direct current  use up to ten times less power     7  Check your TV cabinet  save up to  75 Dollars per year      An LED TV uses about half less power than an LCD TV and three quarters less than a plasma TV  The larger the screen  the more you can save   Also note the power consumption of the set top box  the decoder   receiver   TV box   A set top box with a hard disk uses almost twice as much power than without  Also  many receivers in standby consume a lot of power  So turn it off completely when you are not using it     8  Turn off devices completely and disconnect plugs     Many devices no longer have a real power switch  but only a standby mode  You can only switch this off completely by pulling the plug out of the socket  This concerns  in particular  the television  computer  and stereo with peripheral equipment and certain kitchen appliances  And remove the charger from the socket when you are not using them  These continue to consume power when you leave them in the socket  especially older chargers  which get hot  consume a lot of power     9  Defrost your freezer     A freezer works best if you defrost it regularly  An ice layer of more than two millimeters on the freezer element means ten percent more power consumption  And then immediately set the freezer to  18 degrees Celsius  colder is not necessary  Do you want to defrost something from the freezer  Then put it in the fridge  so your fridge doesn t have to work as hard again     10  Use a thermos flask     The hot plate is the large flow slurper of the coffee maker  So pour your coffee into a thermos as soon as possible after brewing  Are you a tea lover  Immediately after cooking  pour the water into an  other  thermos flask  That way you don t have to switch the kettle on again and again for a cup of tea     1  Switch everything off    In an average household  many devices are always on standby  Most of these devices can simply be turned off completely without disturbing operations  By turning off all devices as standard instead of on standby  an average household can quickly save  45 dollars a year     2  Wash at 30 degrees    The wax is also perfectly clean when you wash it at 30 degrees  And the lower temperature you can easily save  9 dollars per year     3  Hang the laundry    The dryer and centrifuge both use a lot of energy  Also  smells that are dried in the open air are delicious     4  Dry several loads of laundry one after the other    If you still need to use the dryer  make sure you have several loads of laundry ready so that the dryer does not cool down completely between turns     5  Remove the dust from the dryer s filter before every turn    This keeps the dryer working efficiently     6  Use a dishwashing level    You waste huge amounts of water  detergent  and energy when you run the hot tap and do the dishes with it  So use a washing up level  This can save around  50 dollars a year  That is also more economical than using a dishwasher     7  Boil only the amount of water that you need    Do not fill the entire kettle if you are going to make one cup of tea  A lot of energy is needed to make water boil  and the more water there is in the kettle  the more energy is needed  This can save you around  11 dollars a year if you drink a lot of tea     8  Invest in a good thermos flask    If you put hot water directly in a thermos  you only have to boil water once or twice a day for tea     9  Use the oven efficiently    Heating the oven for one pizza or two sandwiches is a waste of energy  Make sure that you can bake several things at the same time and get more out of the same heat     10  Clean the oven air supply    If it is not properly cleaned  the oven can become hotter than necessary     11  Heat your home with cooking heat    Leave the oven open after use to heat your home  Instead of the heat being dissipated by ventilation shafts  it now stays indoors  In the summer that is a less good idea      12  Full freezer    When your freezer is full  less air needs to be cooled and the freezer  therefore  has to work less hard     13  Empty the freezer before the summer holidays    Handy habit  This way the freezer is cleaned at least once a year and does not have to be switched on all the time when you are on holiday     14  Full fridge    Same argument as tip   12  A space in the refrigerator is not only a waste of space but also provides extra energy consumption     15  Replace the strips on the side of the refrigerator    Replace the insulation strips as soon as possible if you feel any cold air outside the refrigerator  An enormous amount of cold air can leak out and therefore energy if the strips do not connect properly     16  Prepare small meals in a small pan    When you prepare a small meal  it is a waste of energy to heat a large pan     17  Eat pans    Taste all your food in one pan     18  Eating from your garden    This may be a slightly larger project  but by growing food in your garden you save all the energy needed to get it to the store  Plus it is  of course  a lot cheaper    19  Cold shower    It will not be nice in the beginning  but with cold showers  you not only save energy  but it is also very healthy     20  Efficient shower head    A water saving showerhead can save a lot of water and electricity  For a family of four  this can save  100 dollars in energy per year and another  156 dollars in water     21  Showering shorter    Logical of course  but when you shower shorter you use less hot water  A shower alarm can help keep track of time     22  Use cold shower water for plants    When you turn on the shower it is not immediately warm  Place a bucket in the shower and collect this water  You can then use this to water the plants     23  LED lights    With the use of LED lamps  you can save around  56 dollars in electricity costs per year     24  Remove the dust layer on lamps    A lot of dust can block up to 50  of the light     25  Heating down    Another tip that seems very logical  However  by turning the thermostat only one degree lower you can save around  95 dollars per year     26  Programmable thermostat    By setting the thermostat so that it automatically goes harder or softer  you will never forget to lower it in the evening     27  Constant heating    It is better to keep the heating constantly at a low temperature than to always switch it on and off  If you still want it to be warmer in the house  raise the temperature a little and not a whole lot at once     28  Sweaters and blankets    By dressing yourself nice and warm and putting an extra blanket on the couch and in your bed  you are less inclined to turn up the heating     29  Mobile charger from the socket    The charger of your mobile uses electricity as long as it is plugged in  So take it out as soon as your mobile is full     30  Use your curtains    Curtains are not only there so that people cannot just peek in at night  They ensure that the heat in the house cannot just escape  So make sure you open the curtains directly in the morning so that the warmth and light from the sun can come in  And close them again in the evening so that this heat is retained     31  Rugs    Rugs provide extra comfort and the heat escapes less quickly     32  Use light dimmers in the home    Dimmers not only give a nice feeling but also save energy     33  Use lights with a motion sensor outside    Lights that come on as soon as you get home and go out when you are indoors are a lot more efficient than lights that stay on all night  or even at night      34  Place lamps in the corners of the room    So that they can reflect on two walls     35  Holiday for you   holiday for all your devices    Remember to turn off all your devices when you go on vacation     36  Use extension cords with a fixed on off button    By connecting multiple devices to an extension cord that you can turn off with one button  you can turn off all devices that are on standby at the end of the day     37  Cook outside in the summer    Cooking outside in the summer means that the cooking heat does not enter your home  This means you need less air conditioning     38  Use a gas or electricity barbecue    Electric or gas barbecues are more efficient with energy and better for the environment     39  Eat together with several people    You save energy by cooking together  but more people in the house also means that the heating does not have to work as hard     40  Use lids when cooking   By using properly closing lids when cooking  the food is cooked faster and you save energy     41  Laptop instead of PC    Laptops use less energy than desktop PCs     42  Check water pipes for small leaks    One drop of water per second rises to 625 liters per month     43  Showering is more economical than taking a bath    Bathing generally costs almost 3 times as much water as a shower  Of course  this depends on how long you shower     44  Vacuum the rinses of the refrigerator twice a year    This keeps the cooling system working efficiently    45  Clean the extractor hood filter    If there is a lot of dust in the filter  the hood must work harder   Here is my  full article   on it if you want to keep reading on other reasons on why power use could be high,https://www.reddit.com/r/Electricity/comments/czyhgn/saving_power/
