rant,2020-08-24 17:54:13,I m fucking sick of the fact that Reddit is a community willing to hate on anything without logical analysis or research ,ifqhsi,11,5,Most prominent example would be hating on China  You either hate China  or you get excluded on Reddit  However  many other topics on Reddit  people always have a one sided conclusion for  Police brutality  stereotyping people  politics  etc   Example  There s the post showing drone footage of a bunch of people in Xinjiang locked up and getting loaded onto a train  People proceed to compare China to Nazi Germany blah blah blah  What they didn t realize is that the footage is actually of convicted prisoners  with a jail name on the back of their vests  getting transported  This fact alone proves nothing  There are even reposts titled along the lines of  China transporting citizens who have done nothing wrong      when they have absolutely no proof  Reading through the comments  not once did anyone mention the fact that the drone s UI was cut out to conceal the location and time the footage was shot   It doesn t matter if China really violated human rights  It s bad to assume things based on impressions  and it s bad to form opinions based on some loose source  One is free to voice their opinion in any way  but getting the facts right is more important than anything in this scenario   Work injury  China work standards and conditions bad   China communist and communist is horrible    Content of a cop facing bad situations  Welp  they re all pigs anyways   All of them deserve to be dehumanized and viewed as trash    Stereotyping older women as Karens  Good  Stereotyping millennials as people who all enjoy gaming and Netflix  You better take this downvote   Nothing can save Karens  and I hate them    Oh you re voting for Trump  Fuck you and hope your family dies  Sanders supporter  Hell yeah let s get it guys   I m sick of it  The majority of time and content spent and created on Reddit are by young  American people  and their logical and emotional fallacies are especially pronounced on many topics  All the quotations are straight from posts that have nothing but one sided comments and downvotes for those willing to rationalize  anything    Can we all just learn to gather and analyze information properly,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/ifqhsi/im_fucking_sick_of_the_fact_that_reddit_is_a/

rant,2020-08-24 21:48:01,i wrote this thing for school a few years ago its sort of a rant,ifv3k5,1,0,Do Video games Cause Violence  The media and many others say  yes but Have they done the research to back this claim up  Many People Including The president and The older generations will tell you that Violent video games make you a violent person or something along those lines  But I Disagree with this And have the information to back Myself up  Unlike Many people who say that they cause violence  I m not saying that Video games don t cause violence among to say younger kids  9 and below  or people with pre existing conditions  I do agree that these types of people may be affected by Games like DOOM or COD  Ect  I do believe that in people with no condition and who are not too young they do not change anything in a person and may do the opposite and help the person with teamwork  Patience  Hand eye coordination  and many other skills as well   The dispute of  do Video games Cause violence has been an ongoing Argument between Gamers and the Media  in which as a gamer I will admit we have been at each other throats on the topic  with the media making News articles and the  gamers  making an endless stream of Memes to go along with them  but who is in the correct in this argument    according to a policy statement from the Media Psychology Division of the American Psychological association scant evidence has emerged  that makes any casual cause or Correlation Connection between playing violent games and actually committing violent acts  According to a  New York Times article by Kevin Draper   This tells us that there is no correlation between violent acts and Video games  In a study by VOX show  the number of Video games sold compared to the crime rates of Different countries and what it found was that America has the most Gun violence and some of the most games sold but not the most  which Japan had they also had one of the lowest gun violence rates in the world  which shows that Video games have only a slight impact on violence  These are some of the Arguments that have been ongoing between our 2 groups in which The Gamers have been in the right so far   The president and many others have blamed video games for school shootings across America instead of the real problem which is the people and how easy it is for a mentally unstable person to buy a gun and ammo for it   If video games did indeed cause some mass shootings  one might expect such events to be common in Japan or South Korea  Both countries spend more per capita on video games than the United States  according to  Newzoo   and have huge video game communities  Japan is home to video game makers like Nintendo  Sega  and Sony  while South Korea has a highly developed competitive video gaming industry   But Japan and South Korea   both of which have very strict laws limiting gun ownership   have among the lowest rates of crime in the world  and mass casualty events are quite rare  This is from an article by the new york times   This tells us that the problem isn t the games it s the Ease of getting a gun in our country and the number of people who hate people who are any different shows a problem with America as a whole with the lack of Descimination Programs for children and just  in general  a lack of education about other peoples  In a chart showing the amount of violence that year and the number of games sold it showed that In 1998 we had the lowest amount of games sold but the highest Violent crime rates  I also showed that game sales increased each year and Violent crime rates went down every year except for a few minor spikes  This again shows that if anything was affected it was the opposite and video games actually lowered crime which I doubt but they certainly didn t increase it  So no the more games people play Doesn t have any impact on their overall personality  maybe a slight personality change but not for the worse    Some may say that some school shooters have played video games which is one Main thing many have pointed out  But that s like saying Just because the school shooter walks he became violent and mentally ile which is completely untrue since 65  of young adults are gamers when the real problem is the stress at home and putting on kids and the expectations they feel have been set for them this combined with other things and it can ruin someone s mental state   Do video games cause violence  No  in this article I have given evidence that states no video games do not cause violence or Make you More Violent and the real problem is the people themselves  I know many people will still say that Video games cause violence but if they did a quick google search they would know instantly that they are completely wrong and if you still don t believe me then whatever go on and believe what you want it doesn t affect any of us we will just keep doing what we enjoy and you can t stop us from doing what makes us happy   Just a side note I have nothing against guns  in fact  I like guns and know a bit about them I just think some extra measures of security would be good  to everyone who thinks I am trying to take their guns away  That s not at all what i m saying      TLDR   gaming doesnt teach you how to pew

rant,2020-08-24 17:28:08,A  god  that is limitless    omniscient  omnipotent  omnipresent and so on    would just as well make every single belief right ,ifq0lk,1,1,An excerpt from a book called  Servant of Darkness Master of Light  on Amazon which is part of the free sample that s available there                                                                                 There is a fad around saying we can t understand god  This comes from individuals conditioned on diminishing themselves  Those who do not want to accept what existence is in its entirety  or see what creation is showing us every single day  First of all  whenever I use the word  god  from now on  I only mean to refer to a generic source  You may understand the word  god  as whatever is most comfortable  for it won t matter or change what comes next  Also  while many religions may have more gods  when they do  these gods are more partial with each one having less functions than the total  So when I say  god   I mean what represents the total    or the fusion and sum of all gods in polytheistic contexts  I d say a very convenient interpretation of the word  god  in the book is one that sees god just as a source  The source of everything that exists   Life is too much of a mystery and the reasons for that are mainly ignorance and selfishness  There are lots of unanswered questions flying around regarding our origins  destiny and the meaning of life  Knowledge from ancient texts that could help has been badly translated  incorrectly interpreted  and at times scattered  destroyed  hidden  or just lost  Luckily  one of the basic characteristics of god is that god is everywhere  What is everywhere is also in our minds and bodies  We literally have god in our hands  If we didn t  or if we weren t to understand more  then god would not be omnipresent  This certainly allows us find answers  God being the source from which all creation comes forth means that all explanations about creation also come forth from god  So  in practice and by logic  god is telling us everything all the time  But first  since we are talking about finding answers and understanding god  we must also define the truth   The truth must be complete and include all possibilities  thus having no exceptions  When we learn something true it is unquestionable  not because of authority  but because it is simply impossible to question truth    unless the question itself is not logical  If you can use logic to question something  it is either a lie or at best an imperfect partial truth  because it left room for sensible questioning  Also  the truth is always simple and powerful  Lies are the ones which are complex  Lies need constant reinforcement to be believed in  Lies are what need authority  effort and repetition to brainwash everyone  The truth does not  In fact  the word  truth  is a synonym for the word  god   since both must be perfect    the reason why it is said  god is the truth   Knowing how to recognize the truth  we may start decoding the rules of existence by simple logic  Since the truth must always make sense  god also must make sense  Logic is our best tool to find the truth  logic is the best way to understand god   Despite the fact many religions exist  the basic premises for the source of everything don t change much  One of these premises is that the source is perfect  having unlimited qualities    omnipotence and omniscience  Our first problem  therefore  lies in saying that god is  good   or that god is  love   or that god is anything too specific for that matter  Being perfect requires perfect balance  and perfect balance is only possible by containing everything  so all counterparts balance themselves  Not good or bad  but both  not love or hate  but both  not peace or conflict  but both  and so on  especially considering when a religion is polytheistic these more specific gods always have their opposites  Since god is even both female and male  I shall refer to god with the  it  pronoun   The source is both dark and light  both water and fire  both earth and air  both death and life  both angels and demons    It would be illogical to say there s anything in creation that did not come from the creator    even ideas  And since all springs from god  this already allows us to conclude that god is neutral  The truth can never choose sides  because it must be exactly what explains absolutely everything  The truth is neutral  As such  everything has a reason to exist  because the total  or god  is always in perfect balance  Therefore  even though everything has a consequence  nothing in creation is  right  or  wrong   for  right and wrong  in most cases are just human judgments and something inherently wrong would simply not exist  We can speak of  right  or  wrong  though in terms of self development  because for those who want to seek any sort of ascension  be it worldly or otherwise  straying from balance is wrong and means distancing oneself from equilibrium  or distancing oneself from the source  Keeping oneself closer to balance naturally requires a balanced path  which we will discuss in many other parts of this book   Now  since the source can only be perfection itself  if we think of something that has reached a state of infinite qualities  we conclude it has no mission anymore  Absolute cognition means having nothing more to learn  Absolute might means having nothing more to practice  Being everywhere means having no new space or time to visit  and considering god is everything  it also is space itself and time itself  meaning that changes in space or time don t even exist at god level  Being everywhere entails being in every possible coordinate of space and time  In a lesser scale  imagine yourself in relation to your home  If you were everywhere  you wouldn t even be able to move inside the house    unless you were to assume a lesser form and pretend you were not omnipresent for some time   Having space and time to move in or even references as  here and there   or  past and future  are mechanisms to be perceived by our imperfect forms that need to navigate existence  At god level there is only  here and now     or in simpler terms  space and time are just ways to make creation function  because for god everything that s ever happened or will ever happen exists  here and now   Both life and death are naturally mechanisms for said navigation of existence too  and can only be just as neutral  since both have positive and negative aspects and carry their shares of pleasure or suffering depending on how they re dealt with   We  in our imperfect forms  can only say we exist while we have a mission  while we have goals to achieve  I know what I know because there s more that I don t  I do what I can because there s more that I can t  There is desire in our imperfection  When I look out to the world  I know what I am based on everything that I am not  If I reach a point where I am everything  then I am also nothing    knowing everything and being capable of everything is ultimately knowing nothing and doing nothing at the same time  Perfection is a dual state of both existence and non existence  The reason why god is the alpha and the omega is thus revealed  which obviously means saying both the alpha and the omega are the same thing  This is exactly the requirement for an infinite loop  Infinity only makes sense when the beginning and the end are the same  as such  creating a loop  accomplishing infinity and making god be the beginning and end of even itself too  God is both the highest and the lowest points of existence  everything and nothing  both the starting and final stages of a game of infinity   I find it important to add now  that this is naturally not about answering the question whether god exists with either yes or no  To understand this  one must throw away all binary views inside existence  because the source is a concept out of existence  or what generates existence  This question can only be answered with both yes and no  especially because the truth can t have any exceptions  so the truth  in fact  can only be the total collective of every possibility  One could even imagine a greater being laughing at all of humanity saying that everyone is right about god  The ones who say it is merciful  the ones who say it is cruel  the ones who say it exists and even the ones who say it does not exist    since god is both everything and nothing at the same time  Nothing stops even a mix of all heavens  all hells and all other planes being real  with everyone going to where they deserve    which  of course  would involve mechanisms far more complex than what people believe     only to spend more time in another incomplete view of the whole system   What better solution than that  People delusionally wishing to impose limits on a limitless concept    limits which are convenient for them    and ignorantly fighting over who is right  while god provides both the ultimate justice and the ultimate joke making everyone right  All with incomplete  but true views    Atheism is right  Islam is right  Judaism is right  Taoism is right  Buddhism is right  Christianity is right  Hinduism is right  Sikhism is right  Jainism is right  all ethnic religions and mythologies are right  Mexican  African  Greek  Norse  Roman  Celtic  Japanese  Chinese    and so on  Logically  god being everything also includes being both  the paladin  and  the trickster  at the same time  distributing all sorts of salvation and punishment that the whole system should require to stay in balance  and if you think something that s limitless can t do that  you re again falling into the trap of trying to limit god   One could argue then  out of misery  that god has a limit and is not everything  If god had a limit  then not even the sciences would have many questions that can only be answered with infinity  Also  while limits may at times be hard to break  they can always be expanded  even the whole universe is currently in constant expansion  Last  but not least  if one chooses to believe in a  limited god   then by logic something else is going to be the absolute god  and the reasoning stays just the same about the absolute source   More importantly  even though this answer might not be perfect  my goal here is to provide something better than what we have  And what we have right now is tons of sectarian and limited views that also limit people  The greatest martial artists become such by knowing at least the basics of every martial art they can  The greatest doctors become such by knowing at least the basics of every system of medicine they can  The greatest beings will only become such by knowing at least the basics about absolutely everything that they can  Striving for greatness will be discussed especially on the last chapter  My point  for now  is that even though it is possible to strive for excellence while belonging to any belief system  most people who belong to a specific belief system end up being satisfied with mediocre answers about everything and being slaves to partial views  God being neutral means that believing or not doesn t even matter  as long as you do not believe something limited and partial  Just as absolutely everything in space and time for god is just here and now we should try to always focus on living in the present doing what we can do here and now  which is expand our own limits in every aspect possible

rant,2020-08-24 11:37:07,Found out how truly horrific my family is   ,ifl90r,1,0,So for context   1  My father is a Narcissist   2  My father is abusive  controlling and very violent   3  We are a  perfect family  purely for his image  and if you deviate even slightly from the  script     may the Lord have mercy on your soul   4  When I was 12 I asked the family lawyer if I could  divorce  my dad because of his constant abuse   5  Mother is preparing paperwork to file for divorce now   6  I m 24 and still stuck in this hellhole   Now let s start from the top   My father has always been absent and replaces affection with money  he doesn t praise or communicate  just throws money at me when I open my mouth  He has always being violent and angry and me  reserved and avoiding conflict   Flashback to when I was 18  engaged and very happy  we knew each other a long time before getting engaged  and I was very isolated  so please don t judge based on my age   My fiancee ended up being very abusive and would beat me to within an inch of my life  When it got too bad  I tried to get out  In the same time as these developments  my father beat my mother for the first time  called me and told me she tried to kill herself  He left town  called me and told me to deal with it   When I got to the farm  she was just sitting on some flour sacks in the storage room with the head farmhand holding her hands  He told me everything that happened   I snapped  loaded them both into the car and headed for the hospital  The hospital gave my mum some pain meds and sent us to the police to report the case  Upon getting to the police station  we try to file a case   My mother couldn t speak properly for 3 months after so I had to do the talking   The police chief calls my father and asks his view on events and he tells the Chief not to believe a word we say since we are both  on hardcore drugs  apparently  The chief put the phone down and asked if we had taken any medications in the past 24 hours  I told him yes  my mother was just given pain medication  He told us that druggies cannot report crimes and to please leave his police station as the  drugs  make my mothers statement unusable   The hospital gave these meds so yeah    uhm OK     Please note that at this point I was PISSED  and I hardly got angry in that time of my life    So we moved in with my fiancee  Where he proceeded to abuse me even more  I then broke up with my fiancee because I had this newfound anger and would fight back when he hit me  leaving scratches and bruises that showed signs of self defense   Ironic that I could stand up for my mother and want to report it but could never do it for myself   Basically  he violated me and forced himself on me several times and I was just too afraid to tell anyone  he was my fiancee after all    My father threatened us with court and forced us back into his  custody   We moved back to the city and left everything else behind  We got locked up in our flat every day for a year until my one old school friend got a job and needed extra help  I started working and getting out of the house  and because I had a job  my father couldn t lock us up anymore because I had to keep up appearances    He tried to hit me once  I blacked out from anger and came to  with my father looking scared of me and backed up against the wall  He has never even lifted a hand near me again   Mom says I get this  face  when the anger switch flips  that face has saved me from many scary situations that could have gone sideways FAST    Everything got better  I started studying and got my mother to join me  so that she too could get out of the house  We have both finished our masters and can t find jobs in the midst of this Corona    My father is gradually getting more violent and will throw things  scream constantly and start raising hands  The stress and panic and anxiety is so bad we both have stomach ulcers and get a lot of panic attacks  My mother has started losing it  but I told her to just divorce him so we can get out  She is organising the paperwork currently  finally    My father is constantly complaining about how expensive I am and I spend too much money  my own money  etc  But I earn less than minimum and can t even afford my own 1 bedroom apartment  even with a frigging degree  When I finally found one at 22  this was two years ago  that I could afford  I paid the deposit and started packing  When he found out he called the owner of the apartment and withdrew my deposit  saying that I would not be moving in    Imagine my surprise when he kept the money and told me that if I ever leave  he will find me  Now 2 years later  I have been saving as much as I can and am packing  I will be immigrating and he doesn t know a thing about this  I refuse to tell him because I KNOW he will try to stop me with all his  connections   or just end up sueing me for something he made up   Another last thing  my father is very  rich  but is millions in debt  he loans money to family friends in exchange for sexual favors  Also not to count the 34 girlfriends I have met know of in the past 3 years   Mom and dad are separated  but not legally    yet   I honestly just feel like I never want kids  to get married or nothing  I just want to be me  with my dog  somewhere far away from toxic people like my father and ex fiancee  In the middle of nowhere  where nobody can hurt me anymore  and if they try  I am ready for them  I have trained my brain and body in order to protect myself and it is now my first and only instinct   This is not how I want to live my life  in fear  horror or suspicion of normal people who are not like those monsters   Sorry for the whole darn life story but I just needed to write it somewhere    and hopefully someone else gets where I am coming from  I know I am not alone in this   TL DR People are jerks and I am angry about it  wanting to live in isolation before I kick said jerk s

rant,2020-08-23 21:52:04,I m really tired of people  specifically Redditors  of blaming Americans when corrupt establishment politicians are elected,if8tby,5,5,The same people who go  durr America is a 3rd world country  look at how much voter suppression there is  also go  Muricans stupid for electing Blumpf  they deserve him as President   How the fuck do these idiots not see the inherent contradiction  The reasons for politicians getting elected in America  and in basically almost every country  is more complicated than just people voting for them    First  voter suppression is a huge problem in the US  The process of voting in America is incredibly  and most likely intentionally made to be  tedious and unorganized  People have to take time out of their busy workdays to wait in long  slow lines just to exercise their basic human right to vote  This is a likely contributor to the disparity in generations who vote  Baby boomers don t have to work long jobs just to make ends meet like Millennials and Generation Z do  so boomers have more time on their hands to vote   Second  the political establishment and institutions in the US are incredibly biased towards wealthy establishment interests  If a progressive candidate actually manages to jump through incredibly difficult hurdles and get somewhat successful in winning elections  they ll eventually get pushed out  This is because US political institutions are built to favor which candidate has the most wealth and resources  Candidates who favor establishment and elite interests will get the most corporate and wealthy class support  thus giving them an advantage over progressive or working class politicians who do not have the support of PACs or corporate interests  Both the major political parties  Democrats and Republicans  have huge amounts of institutional power that is heavily backed by corporate money    Because of this  both parties are structurally biased against any politician who will fight for worker s rights  This makes it near impossible for a politician who will actually help everyday people win  Bernie Sanders being relatively successful in the 2020 primaries was an actual miracle and an incredibly unprecedented moment in US history  The fact that he got that far as a politican who truly supported worker s rights is a sign of growing unrest among Americans about the current system  but his grassroots support could not take the incredibly powerful and organized Democratic establishment    Also because of this  Joe Biden and Donald Trump being the only two choices we have is not Americans  fault  Like I said  both political parties are structurally biased towards establishment candidates  An inherently corrupt and classist political establishment is what got Biden and Trump  not American voters    And lastly  the electoral college  I m sure everyone knows how broken and elitist the electoral college is  but people still blame Americans for voting in Trump despite the fact that the electoral college and all of the shit I listed above is what got him elected  The electoral college is literally a system that has the power to ignore what the majority of Americans want  and people still blame Americans for electing shitty Presidents    But no  let s ignore all of what we wrote and just call Americans stupid  What the fuck does that even accomplish  If you want to fix our socioeconomic and sociopolitical problems  how is insulting everyone s intelligence going to accomplish that  It does nothing but give the pretentious morons who say this a small amount of superiority over people  I swear to fucking god  we live in a global society filled with people who are desperate to feel superior to other people  no matter how fucking petty the particular issue is  This is especially apparent in the fucking Imperial vs Metric system Reddit debates   IT S FUCKING MEASUREMENTS  WHO FUCKING CARES  YOU RE NOT BETTER THAN OTHER PEOPLE BECAUSE YOU USE CENTIMETERS  GET A HOBBY AND FIND SOME OTHER WAY TO BOOST YOUR FRAGILE SELF ESTEEM  FFS,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/if8tby/im_really_tired_of_people_specifically_redditors/

rant,2020-08-22 19:49:02,I was born blind  Nobody wrote this for me ,ielums,136,23,Many people seem to think that the evolution of mainstream technology is on a growing list of reasons why we  blind people  can t function in the world without the help of a sighted person  This is really far from the truth  I use my flat  touch screen iPhone every day with the screen totally blacked out  I can explore the screen  hear the names of the things I m touching  and double tap them to actually choose them  I sit down at my desk and instantly have access to Windows and Mac computers which I ve connected to a mixer and a keyboard switcher so I can control them both at once   The category of software that makes this possible is called a screen reader   NVDA   is probably the one I use the most on Windows  it s free and open source  But every mainstream operating system comes with one built in now  probably in settings under accessibility or something similar  and most of them are really good  They all provide extra touch screen gestures to navigate without being able to see precisely where everything is  and they have lots of extra keyboard commands to quickly search through apps and websites  Even my Samsung TV  Apple TV and Fire cube all have screen reading software that reads the current item as I move around  They aren t magic  they can t figure out what s in a picture for instance  and some web designers and programmers make mistakes that take away my access even though it functions just fine for a sighted user  However  anyone reading this should know that a large portion of Reddit is highly text based and that s one of the many reasons I enjoy being a user here  Besides that  AI is evolving to a level that allows a computer to recognize objects in photos  and any  OCR   app will pull the text out of pictures  which is slightly clunky but doable   Can you imagine being a person who physically could not use the internet or the features of a modern Smartphone  but also couldn t read print  It was fine when I was a kid and didn t really care  I had Braille and audio books galore because my mom is awesome  and nobody really had the internet  But now  everyone has some kind of computer or phone and the whole world is digital  and I m an adult who needs to be able to get through the digital world  I ve been to college  including partially online classes and a ton of computer based homework   and currently do a fairly specialized technical job  I ve lived completely alone for the past 8 years and have continued to do so this year when it would have been unwise to ask anyone for help  Blind people managed without tech  but it didn t take long for people to work out ways of making computers talk  and Apple believed in the accessibility of their devices far more than most blind people did  adding their first mobile version of the VoiceOver screen reader to iOS 3 0  Now  my phone has apps on it to help me read print  look up barcodes  get specialized walking and transit directions  and get immediate professional video help if I need to make sure clothing matches or something  I take advantage of services like Uber  Doordash and Instacart so I can travel and shop relatively independently   The bottom line is that there are a ton of us reading and commenting on posts here  and using the internet in general  And honestly  we re nothing special  We re just people who operate under the limitations we re given  There are sometimes more limitations  but there are also a lot of ways to work around them  and we work together to discover and invent these solutions   It s really common to search for posts about blind people and come up with some Ask Reddit thread asking how blind people do x  y  or z  I love these questions  I actually take the time to answer a lot of them when I get the chance  But it s pretty clear the original poster often doesn t expect an actual blind person to answer  although I m seeing a lot more  Blind People of Reddit     posts recently  so that s encouraging  But still  this assumption is so pervasive that they have helpfully added a sticky to the top of every such post that talks about how blind people use computers and mentions that  ableism   is not tolerated  Despite the sticky  there is always at least one misinformed person somewhere in the comments  I saw an AMA from someone in my Twitter network earlier this month  and the number of  Who is reading this to you  questions was unreal   Honestly  I think the issue goes beyond the assumption that we re shut out of tech  To me  this is a small piece of something larger I experience all the time  the automatic assumption that since a particular task is usually done visually  I can t do it  There s no room for maybes and no willingness to do research  When someone does ask a question knowing we can answer  there s always that one wannabe clown who makes a joke about blind people not being able to read the post in the first place  When someone does an AMA and actually notes that blind people can use computers  people still don t read it all the way and just assume someone is writing and reading Reddit for her  because somehow it s easier to think a sighted helper is the solution to her technology use than it is to imagine that technology  is  the solution  And honestly  I think if the consequences of these assumptions didn t affect me at all  I would laugh  Sometimes I do anyway  because it s just sheer stupidity  But the fact so many people are able to see a post that asks blind people questions and automatically think  Wow  that s stupid  no blind person is going to read this   or see an AMA and think  Wow  who s reading these comments and typing the answers   rather than  Hey wait a minute  technology is awesome right  So maybe there s a way blind people can use Reddit and I don t know about it  Why don t I google that or ask in a comment   speaks volumes about how content a large portion of society is with the belief that we re simply shut out of something everyone else takes for granted  And it s one thing to have our capabilities questioned by Redditors  but some of those Redditors are also employers who need to decide whether to hire us  programmers who need to follow standards to make their software accessible to us  or customer service people who just need to stop asking my mom or my Uber driver questions about me as though I can t hear them   Seriously  why do people do this    I honestly believe that in general  people are open minded and interested in learning  but the biggest uphill battle for myself and so many others is just getting people to stop assuming we re incapable  and start trusting that we know our own limits enough to stop considering us a liability  And don t get me wrong  there are people who don t actually have the skills or experience to do something as well as they think they do  and like any minority  they ll turn around and call someone ableist for pointing out what is obvious  Maybe I ve been one of those people at some point in my life  It s easy to feel like the entire world forces us to prove ourselves time and again in a thousand small ways  It s easy to hold onto something as small as the time you told a stranger you knew where you were going four times and they still walked behind you and told you when to turn left  robbing you of the ability to prove you did in fact know where you were going   I won t be one of those people  and I sincerely hope this post doesn t unnecessarily shame anyone  I just want people to think that maybe there s another way to accomplish something  and maybe we can actually do that thing you thought we couldn t do  I will also say that for everyone who assumes  there are always ten more people who are really interested and will ask lots of insightful questions which actually make me stop and consider the answer  and a hundred who stay silent because they know I can  I appreciate all of those people  My inbox is open  people do AMAs all the time  and there is also a blind subreddit is where you can find most blind people of Reddit as well as answers to a lot of frequently asked questions   Thanks so much for reading this far,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/ielums/i_was_born_blind_nobody_wrote_this_for_me/

rant,2020-08-23 16:26:19,My mother made my family hate me,if35iq,2,2,I am so tired and angry I really need to rant right now    My mother is not a good mother  she is very much toxic  she used to drink so much everyday and was never here for me and my siblings  my eldest brother that we will call Bernard used to beat the shit out of my other big brother that we will call André  I was never hit by Bernard but I still grew up in thr terror of being hit  I had my first sexual relation when I was so young by a family member and it lasted till I understand what was happening to me and made ut stop  I feel so dirty because of that and can t stand my own body and it all happened because my mother though she was such a perfect woman and that we were all happy    I used to think that woman was a godess  she told us she did everything for us  and I trusted her  I though she was the best woman on earth  she told me my dad was never here for me of my brothers so I though she was right and I asked him why he never payed for anything  I didn t wanted to go to his house  and one day I realised that she was manipulative  and everything started to fell appart for me    I started to realise she had a drinking problem  one time I asked her if she wanted a drink   tu veux à boire     I was thinking about water  and she got really angry at me telling me she was no alcoholic    I decided to go more and more at my dad place and get to know him  he was really happy  but every time I was at her place she started an argument  getting yelled at everyday because I dared to have a good time at my dad place  because I should hate it here    It was so tiring  I was in my worst place at that moment  depression  suicidal thoughts  I hurted myself in a regular basis  and with all her yelling it didn t helped me at all   On day I told her I was not okay  and she told me I didn t know what was depression  that I didn t have the right to says that  I didn t even said I had depression because I wasn t diagnosed     It hurt me so much  but you know what  I said nothing  I comforted her  every time I got yelled at for nothing I said nothing  because I was afraid of her  I just let her verbally abuse me almost every day My favorite time was school because I was in boarding school  I hate school  it was stressful and the girls in my room could have been better  but I still preferred to be here than at her place    This years I was an Aupair  one full years away from everyone  and I was happy  for the first time in my life I was not stressed  I started to work on my trauma  I was so happy    But my contract finished and I come back last saturday  I didn t wanted to see her   But I was afraid of her yelling at me  so tuesday at 18 00 I was at her place  she looked normal as usual  she asked for hugs  I don t like hugs and it s worse from her  I let her do it because I was afraid of her reaction  I had a friend with me that didn t wanted me to be alone   The next day  she goes off on me  for no reason again I wad playing a game with my friend and my sister and suddenly I am a little bitch and it s my fault my grandma  her mother  is dying  I saw her she look very much alive and anyway she is 93    She stressed my friend so much that she started to cry once my mother was not her anymore  she come back to her home soon after   The next day was the day I saw my therapist who know my mother  since a year she told me my mother was toxic and I needed to get away from her  she was still on her word   In the afternoon I was watching a cartoon on the TV in english with english subtitle  my mother got pissed of at me because I am horrible to do that to my sister  who wasn t watching the TV  and I could at least put it in french  the french dub is not my cup of tea and anyway the translation make a lost to the original   My grandma  dad side  call  she take my phone to talk to her  and my little sister  10  ask who it is  our mother told her it was grandma  my sister says hello  but like  we don t have the same father  I told her it s not her grandma because I was thinking she though it wad hers   After the call my mother goes off on me because it was cruel and disgusting of me to have said that  I says sorry    Anyway my mother still decide to yell  I am afraid I go in my sister room  I don t have my own room anymore  and start to pack a bag to pass the night at my friend place because I am scared and sad and upset to be yelled at again  I realise my phone charger is outside the room and ask my sister to get it  She come back hand empty with my mother behind her  seeming very angry and yelling at if she was afraid of her   t as peur de moi maintenant      My sister cry and tell her yes  that she always scream at me  that she made my friend cry the day before   And now you have to understand  my mother is the queen of acting like a victim  like she never done something wrong  like everyone is bad to her  and she is really gopd at guilt trip people  She start to cry    And I know where it s going  I can already heard her saying how could my sister  my ten years old baby sister can say something so hurtful    I can get yelled at  she can say I am a bitch  I am egoist  I am a whore or anything else  she can says that  but trying to guilt trip at 10 years old    I couldn t   And yes I did an error  I screamed back at her  I screamed she didn t have the right to cry   We screamed back and forth to each other  my bag is already packed  I was scared she hit me  I ran away to my friend for the night  I didn t insulted her so  I yelled at her to leave us alone mostly    The next day I come back  my bags are packed  she told me my dad come to me    And I learned she told everyone I hit her    I receive a horrible message from Bernard but explained the truth to André  he trust so it s okay  my sister looked at me right in the eyes and told me she hate me    My mother family is sending so much text I don t have the force to read  my mother send me 5 text that I didn t open because it started by  Tu n imagine pas le mal que tu nous as tous fait  so basically that I hurt them all    My dad s girlfriend don t like me and want me out of the house as soon as possible  I had a shitty pay and obly have like 300  with me and Bernard want to destroy all my stuff  I am 18  I don t have money nor a home and I am so lost  I

rant,2020-08-23 04:26:32,Reddit is both the best and worst website I ve ever used  It has helped me in many ways  and bothered me in many others      ,ieum02,13,2,I think I ve been using Reddit for a little more than a year now  though this account is only a few months old  For a while  all I did was browse  I never cared to jump into any conversation  At some point I decided to actually get involved in the different communities  and after about a year of being on this site  I feel like expressing my thoughts      and ranting a bit    Now  I don t hate Reddit  Actually  I really like a lot of the aspects of this website  I ve seen lots of positivity in many different communities  and have actually gotten some great advice on very serious matters  There are some truly great people on this website           but like every mainstream website  Reddit isn t immune to the more  toxic side of the internet  The toxicity on this site can spread from any community  whether it be a gaming subreddit  or a political subreddit  There are a lot of people on this site who think they re way smarter than they really are  and act like complete assholes because of it   I m not saying I m perfect  and that I haven t said some stupid things when online  But some people on this website really take it to the next level  It honestly takes the fun out of conversation  because what s the point in talking with a pretentious jerk   Anyway  here s the good  and the bad of my experience on Reddit         The Good    Like I said  this website has allowed me talk about a massive variety of different topics  and has allowed me to have some great discussions    I ve found so many different communities  each of which giving me an opportunity to talk about things that interest me  and the chance to get advice on some very important issues    For example  the different writing and worldbuilding subreddits are filled with really kind  casual people  You can ask for advice  or just casually talk about a certain idea you ve had  and from my experience  I ve always met a really positive group of people on these subreddits  Same goes for the artistic subreddits  Overall  this site has given me the chance to be creative  and share the creativity with some really nice people   I ve mentioned this a few times now  but this site has also given me the chance to talk about some very serious issues in my life  and I have gotten some great advice from some really kind people  I don t even know who s on the other side of the screen  but whoever is there  they ve devoted their time to help me  someone they don t even know  I ve gotten advice and insight on mental health  and life plans  and so on  I definitely wish I could thank the people on this site  who ve taken the time to talk to me when I needed it         The Bad    Now let me clarify  I believe that for the most part  Reddit is a website with a positive community  I d like to believe the toxicity of this sight is only relegated to certain areas  and isn t that widespread  Of course  I m not entirely sure   The mors toxic and shitty side of this website isn t just limited to a few communities  There are assholes everywhere  whether it be a media based subreddit  or a world news based subreddit  So yeah  some of these problems aren t that big of a deal  Like  some guy on the Playstation subreddit might be an asshole  but it isn t gonna ruin my day or anything  Still  it s annoying how even a casual conversation can turn to shit because of a few assholes   Here s a quick example  I made a post on how I think the new Avengers game is really good  I made sort of a mini review  and expected some interesting conversation  Instead  70  of the people commenting didn t actually care about any real conversation  and just wanted to yell about how I enjoy a game they didn t  or how I used their favorite game in a comparison they thought was  unfair    I know this sounds petty  and it probably is      but it sucks when you want to talk about a video game you really like  and your opinion gets shit on because it doesn t follow the general consensus  It takes the fun out of discussions    This is a more minor example  and it isn t that big of a deal  but it shows how even in a conversation about something as casual as video games  can turn to shit for no reason    I feel like the reason this site has such a toxicity issue is because a lot of Redditors wildly overestimate their intelligence  and because they re online  no one can judge them for being jerks  They act like they know everything  and can read your entire personality from a Reddit comment        Now  I won t lie  on that thread I mentioned earlier  I made some pretentious sounding comments in response to some of the other comments  But to be fair  it s hard to talk back when someone s being such an asshole  it s hard to come up with a response  Though now I ve decided not to even waste my time with those people         Look  in the end  this site is a bit of a mixed bag  There s some good  and some bad  just like anything in the world  That s just how it is  And in the end  the bad parts of this site don t ruin the positive sides  I ve had some good experiences on this site  it d be dumb to act like those don t matter because of a few jerks   Hell  even that Avengers thread I mentioned still got me some good comments  There were people legitimately willing to have interesting discussions  I just lost focus of that because some of the other people were being annoying  But the point is  this site is mostly full of some really nice and cool people  The negative aspects aren t that big of a deal  all things considered,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/ieum02/reddit_is_both_the_best_and_worst_website_ive/

rant,2020-08-23 11:28:24,I really don t know what to put here,iezpzv,3,2,Hey guys  I never thought I d rant to strangers but today s the day I guess  If you don t like personal rants I m sorry but this is one  I don t really know a specific thing to rant about so I guess I ll start with whatever I can think of  I just need these things off my chest  I m a high schooler by the way   Covid  I hate America  The coronavirus is bad but the way America is handling it is worse  The pandemic could ve ended in 4 6 weeks but no  It didn t  Because of that I ve had to miss out on summer and school  I know that s better off than so many people but I just have to say these  pathetic  things  In the 7th grade I decided I want to be a teacher  I really do  I love working with children and just watching someone understand something feels wonderful  Because of the quarantine I am missing out on my teaching internship  my school has one   I also love biology  It s so memorizing  There s tiny little processes going on in every single cell of your body  Right now you re probably going through so many things without even knowing what they are  I especially love anatomy  I m decently good at it too  I m gonna miss out on taking the course in person and oh god dissections would ve been amazing  Girlfriend  I love her  We ve been together for a year and half  not A LOT I know   But it does feel like she s the one  I m a weird kid  I m not smart or tall or hot or interesting or anything  I don t why she s with me  I don t understand how someone could actually love me  I don t know if I even deserve to be loved  My parents probably love me  My baby brother definitely does though  Anyways  I m worried  I don t know if I can give her the life she deserves  Teachers don t make a lot  And I don t want to put pressure on her  We ve talked about our future and we both want the other to pursue what they want  She s really supportive of my teaching vision but I don t know if it ll be enough  I don t know if I ll even get a job or get into college  I also think she might not like me  I ve gained some weight during covid and well  I look a lot worse  She s been busy with school work so we rarely call anymore  Actually we don t call anymore  I don t want to disturb her studying  I just wish that maybe she d want to see me sometimes  I know that emotionally  she loves me  But physically  I feel like she s disgusted by me  I ve seen the guys she s called hot or handsome  I m nothing like them  I m not blonde or 6ft or fit or white or anything  I m a 5 9 Indian kid  I m beyond ordinary  I wouldn t even be cast as an extra in a movie  I just wish maybe my girlfriend could make me feel better  But that s not her job  School college    I took AP biology last year  If you don t know  AP classes are college level classes that are just harder versions of the normal ones  At the end of the year they offer a test that gives college credit if you pass it  I didn t pass it  I mentioned before I loved biology  I m good at biology too  I know that s not humble or anything but I am  I ended with a 96 in the class  I did well on all the tests and quizzes and everything  I know I m good at it  But all the college board has told me is I got a 2 5  I can t know more  I want to quit bio  I m not worthy for it  I can t call myself a biology or anatomy teacher if I fail it  College board also has the sat  It s a test that gets you into college  I suck at the sat  The questions themselves aren t hard  I know what I m doing when I m taking it but for whatever reason I m stuck at 1200  out of 1600   I know I m not smart but I know I m not dumb either  Or atleast I think that way  Kind of sidetracked but society  Please don t make the ideal man perfect  The ideal man is 6ft  with blue eyes and a 8 inch dick  I have nothing wrong with him being absolutely jacked with 10 pack abs  I don t care about muscles or anything  I just hate that men have to be born perfect  If you re below 6ft you re below 6ft  End of story  You can t diet to change you can t hit the gym to change it you can t do anything to change it  I m stuck at 5 9 and I always will be  I m only 3 inches away but I still feel so short  I have brown eyes  Not interesting  My girlfriend thinks they re boring she has brown eyes too   They re definitely common but they aren t boring  In right light they look like honey  And in the dark they just blend in  They re fascinating  If you re a woman reading this  please I beg of you  love your boyfriend fiance husband  If they don t love you back tell them  But if they re good to you then please show it back as much as you can  If you do the right little things I promise he ll cry in joy and comfort   You ve reached the end  I don t think anyone would go through my rant  It ll be lost among many others  1 up vote by me and 0 comments  But that s not the point  It doesn t matter that nobody reads this or a thousand do  I didn t rant for feedback  I ranted to get all this stuff off of my chest  However  if you are reading this  I beg my 300 000 brown gods that you have an amazing day and that happy things happen to you

rant,2020-08-23 16:22:29,Why does love have to hurt so much ,if33c3,1,14,I m sorry if this isn t the right place for this  if it s not then tell me where would be better and I ll post it there instead    Let me start with some background about myself  I m a 26 year old male and I ve never been the person to get overly emotional about a relationship or a person  I ve had  what I feel  is a decent amount of relationships up to this point on my life  I m a great people person and don t do to bad with the ladies  That was until about 4 years ago  I also wanna preface this by saying I ve never been into the idea of getting married  I have no problem with commitment  I just never liked the idea of spending large amount of money on one day to prove my love to someone and I d rather use that money to make more exciting memories   So 4 years ago I met this girl and I immediately knew she was special  This was the first  and so far only  one I ve even considered marrying  We got along so well  we went on trips together  we could have fun going out or staying in  we both pushed each other to do the best we can at everything  we were both so supportive  we always had things to talk about  just everything felt so right  We had an absolute blast for about 2 1 2 years  but the entire time we had trust issues  Which I ve never had a problem with  but it always felt that she projected a lot of her insecurities into our relationship  Well eventually she broke up with me and shortly after I found out she cheated on me  twice  I was heart broken  I felt so betrayed and like I wasn t good enough  Which again  I ve never felt that way before  I really had thought that I found  the one  and it felt like it was just ripped away from me and there was nothing I could do     Then around last October we started talking and I decided to give her another chance  I had moved to NYC by then  for multiple reason  the timing of a lot fell in place  but one was to be further from her  and she ended up coming to see me  It was great and I felt kinda whole again  But I couldn t shake that fact that she cheated on me and when I came home for Christmas I went and saw her a few times but it just never felt right  I told her we couldn t continue  I m gonna be honest and say  I wasn t really hurt this time  I felt better because at least I had given it a shot and I knew this time it was because I wanted it    Since then she has reached out to me here and there but it s never lead anywhere because I won t let it  I don t wanna put myself in the same situation again  I thought I was really doing better and making progress forward  Until I started realizing  I have no interest in anyone  I ve gone on dates but none have lasted more than the first date  I just can t do it  I have kissed two girls and slept with one but I honestly didn t want either  I just did it hoping to feel better  I know how shitty that sounds     I haven t even tried to talk to a girl in 3 months  I compare everyone to her  I know I shouldn t but I wasn t really aware I was doing it  Anytime I think I even like someone  once we start talking  I just lose any amount of interest I had  I just kinda chalk it up that they weren t right for me  even though some have been wonderful people  I wanna say  it s not that I don t think they are good enough for me  I just don t think they re the right fit for me    I thought I just need to give myself more time  so for the past 3 months I ve been focusing more on myself  Trying to do things I enjoy and not worrying about others so much  She had messaged me about a month ago and sent me all the pictures of us from her phone and said she was deleting them  I didn t like that because it felt like she didn t want them but she wanted to push it all on me  I stayed strong and just said that I hope it helps  I thought I was doing really well  until 3 nights ago  now she s started appearing in my dreams  This is new for me since most of the time I don t have super vivid dreams  but these are crystal clear  I ll even wake up in the night and when I finally fall back to sleep  there she is in another dream  every time  I felt like I was finally making progress and now I feel worse than before  Now I m laying in bed just wishing I could talk to her    I just want to feel better and feel whole again  I wanna feel like I did before I met her  I m not saying that I wish it hadn t happened  I m glad it did  I learned so much from that relationship  more than I had learned from any other  I know that I m young and I know that I ll eventually meet someone else but I ve just never felt so damaged and broken before  If I ever have kids  not super big on that either  then I know I ll never love someone as much as I love my child  but this was a person that really changed a lot of my outlooks  This is someone I thought I could really grow with    Thanks for coming to my Ted talk    But seriously  thanks for listening to  reading  my rant  I know it s a long one  I just needed to get it off my chest  Sorry if anything is confusing  if you have any questions  comments or concerns let me know  And sorry if it s kind of a

India is a bad country to live in but there is no country which is perfect and where people don t face any kind of racial discrimination  the majority anywhere will always try to prove that they are better and superior than others   I know that the Sikhs have made a place for themselves and their religion in US UK Canada Australia but as I read through these message boards and comments I realised that there are more people who hate brown people and Sikh men in these countries and everywhere else than those who do not  White people or other POC don t say things openly because they are afraid to be labelled as racists  People on reddit will never outwardly say their thoughts because their comments may get removed  Indians are called shit skin  pajeet  towel head and various other derogatory remarks both on the internet and in real life  all these racist people have this image that all Indians have sub standard living conditions and are poor   yes  poverty is real in India and it s true that poor people have to live in slums or low residential areas but not everyone is poor and times are changing  We have people who are millionaires and billionaires in our country  people who come from middle class earning group but the government is more concerned about making these millionaires and billionaires more rich than taking care of poor and middle class people  All the politicians and governments have been corrupt till date and its just how efficiently you can hide your money or which religious group you can attract with false sense of hope and promises what makes them win elections   I am afraid of facing racial discrimination wherever I go and whichever country I move to  I want to live separate from my parents but I can t go to some of the above mentioned countries because there is one or two relatives of mine already living there and I neither want to meet them nor tell my parents that I am living in that country and city  But I am also hesitant to go elsewhere because of my brown skin and turban and always being a target for some white supremacist or other racists to mistake me for being a Muslim  with the chance of being run down on the road  beaten in an alley or shot down by a gun owner  I don t understand that why people who lose their jobs and other shit instead of thinking about why it happened to them or why they were the ones to be fired start blaming immigrants  If you had a job and you lost it  it was not because of a brown skinned turban non turban guy from India but maybe because you were hired on a contract basis and your contract expired or you were not doing your job properly and were just lazing around during work hours   It is the fault of the media that they will only show the poor areas of India and not the urban areas  News channels will show only the bad events that occur in India and not the good things that might have occurred here  YouTubers who come to India instead of showing the urban and developed areas will just travel to the poor regions and then those who watch these videos will assume that whole India is like this  I am not saying that don t show the poor areas  show them but also let the world know about the more beautiful and developed regions  they need to break the already set poor image of India  To get more views and fuel the people s image of a poor and under developed India they can try making two videos showing both sides of India   I wanted to ask a question to all the white supremacists and other POC who discriminated and said racial slurs towards people who looked different from you  do you think you will live forever  Will Jesus Christ forgive you for hating towards another human being because of his different skin colour and different religious practices  Do you think that Jesus was white and not a brown person from middle east   To those who believe in reincarnation  do you think that in the next life you will have the same skin colour and race as you have now  Don t you think what will happen if you were born as brown or black person in the next life and you will have to face same discrimination that you are currently doing and teaching your children,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/ieju8m/i_am_afraid_to_leave_my_country_and_work_abroad/

rant,2020-08-21 02:57:58,The customer isn t always right and I shouldn t be yelled cursed at over it ,idlxss,25,6,Hi  horribly disgruntled McDonald s worker here  I ve posted before about how I hate this job during a pandemic but now I m here because of two incidences in the past week    The first incidence is as follows   A fairly new person  think like 3 weeks  is in the second window handing out food during a lunch rush  She s doing very well  but the person in the first window somehow totally screwed up the order of cars and paid several out wrong  The new person was confused  so she called me over to assist  The man in the window said his order was two hot and spicy mcchickens with cheese and Mac sauce and a large tropic berry sprite  This order was 5th on our screen  but also ready  so I said just hand it out to him  The drink machine was still making his drink  but apparently this was a horrible travesty  This man started shouting how we needed to  hurry the fuck up   he s  at lunch   so loud that my manager could hear it from 15 or so feet away  He gets to the window and tries to defuse the man  but he starts shouting that  that bitch didn t give  him  the drink  and something about hurrying up again  My manager starts yelling back to the point I thought they were gonna throw hands through the windows  The new person asks if she can go to the bathroom  so I just said yeah because she looked shaken up  Whatever  she s new  she ll get used to this  Until she came back and we saw her eyes were red and puffy  she was crying  So my manager sent her on break  and a little while later I went to get a drink check on her  She proceeded to show me specific scars and discolorations on her arms and told me she had left an abusive relationship a few months prior and the man shouting triggered her  I told her to stay on break as long as she needed and that I d explain to the managers the situation if she was okay with it  which she was  She took her normal break and came back  but we didn t put her back in the window  Knowing that a grown ass man made my crew member cry pissed me off to no end  but she seems okay now  She didn t stay down for long and was very grateful that we had her back    Now  for today s incident   I m now the person at the first window taking money  but I m also taking orders from one of the drive through lanes  we have 2   This one may take some background information    The difference between a McDouble and a double cheeseburger is a single piece of cheese  the double cheese has 2 but a McDouble has 1  The system does not let anyone add a piece of cheese to a McDouble because that s now a double cheeseburger and should be rang in as such  We also have this  bundle  which is a McDouble and a small fry for  3    So this man comes in and asks for the  3 bundle with no mustard or ketchup  but to add mac sauce  upcharge   lettuce  upcharge   and an extra piece of cheese  I gently try to explain that I can t add cheese to a McDouble but I can give him a double cheeseburger with the modifications  however that would nullify the  3 bundle deal  This man gets irate   I ve gotten this at every other McDonald s  why are you being so difficult   To which I reply  I m just trying to ring in the correct food because the system won t let me add cheese to a McDouble because    well that s not right  You re crazy  I want a McDouble with an extra piece of cheese    Sir  that s a double cheeseburger  that one piece of cheese    no  it s fucking not  Just give me a McDouble with extra cheese  lettuce  and mac sauce   So being fed up with the man  I rang in a double cheeseburger with the specific modifications  He was then passed when the total was over  5  He asked once again why I can t make a McDouble with extra cheese  to which I literally tilt my screen toward him and attempted to show him how it literally won t let me ring it in  but he gets more mad and throws his card at me  I luckily caught it  charged it  gave it back  and said  Have a nice day  like I m supposed to  And this man says   yeah and I hope you have a shitty day  bitch   At this point  I m done caring and tell him   you re the one with the nasty attitude   He started saying more rude things that I ignored and I quickly cut him off and said  I don t have to deal with you   and slammed the window shut and walked away  I am expecting a manager to come talk to me or something  but my last day is literally 3 days from today and I couldn t care less about repercussions  He either didn t complain or my manager knew I was right because no one said anything to me    The whole point of this rant is that you should just be fucking nice to people and get your head out of your ass and listen to what the people actually running the business say  If he hadn t been a dick while ordering  I probably wouldn t have charged him for a double cheeseburger  but I needed to prove a point  Be nice to the people who are making your food  Be nice to everyone in general  Times are too crazy to be a fucking dick,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/idlxss/the_customer_isnt_always_right_and_i_shouldnt_be/

rant,2020-08-20 17:26:38,Not everyone has to have kids of their own to be fulfilled or create a family     ,idb9g8,8,2,I think it s great if you want to have kids  Personally I think even people who are anti kids of their own feel that human urge to bring a child into this world  It s innate  It s human biology   My problem is with the people that constantly say to me  oh  well maybe you ll change your mind  which has been a constant theme my whole life  I m approaching 30 now and when I was in my teens and 20s I could understand the comments  Back then I was informed  oh  well maybe you ll change your mind by the time your 30   don t forget you re still really young   My feelings haven t changed very much my whole life   The reason I don t want to have children  baby of my own  isn t because I m not up for raising a child  Personally I believe that I d be a great parent and I reckon I d really enjoy the challenge of parenthood even though it s not easy  I m always told this by people as I rapport well with children and I have my nieces and nephews as evidence of that  I have a multitude of reasons and when I explain these reasons to people it s irritating when you are met with the same comments about  changing your mind    I understand it s fantastic having a child  I understand that bringing a child of your own into this world must feel incredible   Giving them a chance to enjoy existence  Creating a family   Carrying on your name legacy  The fact they ll have your partners and your psychological physical features  continuing your genes   Having that undying love and bond with them giving and receiving unconditional love  Creating and moulding their life and raising them to love and respect others   The drive purpose meaning influence it can bring to your life   Watching them become a little walking and talking comedian  because children are hilarious  and even becoming a friend   Watching them with all their  firsts  throughout their life   Maybe even fixing the mistakes your parents may have made   The worry of who will care for you when you re older or the fear of being alone in the later years of your life or even before  The list could go on   Which brings me onto why I deny the desire to have children of my own   Future global warming environmental issues  we have no idea whether we will have an Earth we can call home e g 2050 maybe more    It s also one of the most environmentally damaging things you can do as it means using additional resources and creating more emissions through doing so   Which also brings me onto over population and having the resources to sustain life on this planet for 8 10 billion or more  population around WW1 1 5 billion and today it s 7 7 billion in approximately 100 years   An extra life on this Earth is said to create an additional 60 tonnes of co2 a year  The cost of raising a child from birth to 18  approx  100K in the UK   We also don t need to bring children into this world as we can adopt  There are already so many unwanted children in this world that need homes before I need to bring a child into it  In general the stress it can bring yourself and your partner and potential problems it may bring to your relationship  even the strongest ones   Potential disabilities and the cost stress that that may entail  I ve seen first hand parents struggling with children with disabilities and the cost strain it has put onto couples and single parents  In general it restricts spontaneity  freedom  ability to travel the world and your freedom on a day to day basis  If you want to get that freedom back it means having to get childcare for example  Therefore the extra cost difficulty that may entail if you don t have adequate support  The constant worry that they are okay  By this I mean that the world can sometimes be a dangerous playground even into their teens and adult years  Leading on from one of the pros above  it is also a mistake to believe your child will care for you or you won t be alone as not all children do stick around for their parents   Don t get me wrong  both my partner and myself constantly say that if we change our mind then we should talk about it  We always keep communication channels open and we both believe it s important to do so  We are both open to that possibility but the likelihood is slim  We are more open minded to adoption but even that seems slim at this point in our life   People believe we will both have regret or miss out on stuff if we don t have kids  Many parents say they don t regret having children which I understand due to the unconditional love you have for them  That bond in many cases is unbreakable  It is also true that parents also miss out on a lot of stuff through having children and I believe even if they don t admit it that sometimes they may even regret having children of their own  I used to wonder if this was the case and I may be very wrong  but I have read about a lot of parents speaking out about regrets anonymously online   Lastly  even a child free home means you can create a family and I don t believe a child always enriches that experience   So  next time someone says they don t want kids and not because they hate kids but because they have a valid reason  please respect that those reasons are just as valid as the reasons that made you decide to have children,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/idb9g8/not_everyone_has_to_have_kids_of_their_own_to_be/

rant,2020-08-20 20:31:27,Is there such a thing as justice ,ider1z,2,0,I don t know if this is even what this sub is for  I just feel so close to boiling over and I typed in Reddit Rant   I just don t know  guys  How does it work  Is there a force in the universe that means that what goes around comes around  Is karma a thing  Does justice  not a cosmic  holistic justice  but the man made thing  even fucking exist    The most recent three things that have me furious     My sister is a good person  She would give the extra change back to the cashier if she was given too much  She s that kind of person  Kind  thoughtful  pleasant  You know the kind of person  Usually keeps herself to herself and lives a quiet life  Then  for whatever reason some girls do  she found herself attracted to an older man  A cocky  overly confident  older man  They got into a relationship and she fell pregnant   Then the abuse began  To my knowledge it was never physical  All mental  Controlling  criticizing  correcting everything she said in front of other people  Putting her down and being a general cunt   So she left him  Brave thing to do in a small town  Which I know sounds ridiculous  but if you re not from a small town you probably cant understand the social pressure that s on people to just keep a brave face  The  now ex  boyfriend is popular  On all the sports teams  always in the pub  On the surface a nice guy   Anyway  after the baby was born my sister had decided not to put his name on the birth certificate  In Scotland  I m not sure about other locations  if the couple arent married  the mother can decide not to put the father on the birth certificate and as a result the dad has no legal obligation to the child  She had come to the decision after being told many times that he planned to take the child away from her and deny any contact   Then the texts began  She was bombarded with abuse and nastiness  It went on for weeks  The police were contacted and it was established  There s no proof that it s him    There s more  guys  You might still be reading  You re probably not  I m just letting this flow through my fingers and its like a release     I was finishing work just the other day when my phone buzzed in my pocket  It was my sister telling me that my gran had just been attacked  My gran  But she s an old lady who doesn t go out  She lives in sheltered housing  How could she have been attacked   The council have moved an alcoholic junkie into the house next to her  This lady had walked into my grans house  My gran was in the kitchen  She turned around and this lady grabbed my grandmother by the throat  With her hands clamped around her neck  she pushed her back and straight into the oven  The whole front of it shattered  I m not actually sure what happened next  I ve not been told a straight story  My sister sent me pictures of my grans injuries and the smashed oven   The police were of course involved  They came and spoke to the lady  BUT    no witnesses  It seems that the whole thing has been dropped by them   My sister has spoken to the local MP about getting the lady moved  but    fuck me  A junkie walks straight into an old ladys house at 3 in the afternoon and tries to strangle her  the police come  speak to the lady then say theres nothing that can be done and fuck off     I work for a company thats UK wide  It requires no skill  I am at peace with that  I should have tried harder at school  I shouldn t have picked the degree I did  I have no self pity  This isn t even the hand I was dealt  this is the hand I earned   Ever since I started there has been this other employee who is a bully  He s loud  Brash  Offensive  Racist  Rude  But he s careful and he s sneaky  He knows how to get away with it  He brown noses the managers and has his little posse of friend co workers who he never lets see the true cunt just below the surface   There have been several instances since I ve started of being asked what s he been up to by the other managers  It was usually just him talking down to other staff and walking a fine between being racist to the Polish coworker on my department but a few months ago he went too far in the wrong direction and was his true self to the gay member of the department  B I G  M I S  T A K E  My coworker complained and mentioned it was homophobic in nature  Boom  Red lights  Alarms  All hands on deck  This wouldn t look good to the company  An investigation was underfoot  It actually felt like we were going to be rid of this arse   We were taken one at a time into an interview  The conversations were written down word for word  I told the entire truth  I was asked to describe him  I called him a     petty and pathetic man     which he by far fucking is  Everyone else in the department was interviewed  as I mentioned  and right at the end we were told that due to the investigation  he was the right to see the transcript  Would I like my name to be omitted  I said no  I hadn t said anything in the interview I wouldn t want my name connected to  Wellllllll  it turns out I was the only one to do that  So yay   Anyway  he played the mental health card  Took sick time off with depression and anxiety  Now he s back in a different department  and it turns out he s going to come back to the original department  Nothing has changed  Not a thing   I ve lost a lot of my fire by writing this  If you ve read it all  well done  I know it s not a massive thing compared to what s happening in the world  It just when all this shit happens it really makes me wonder Whats the point  Why play by the rules if it means nothing  Arseholes win   I m not saying im a saint  But my gran and my sister  I m just sad tbh   Thank you for reading  Any of your thoughts would be much appreciated x,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/ider1z/is_there_such_a_thing_as_justice/

rant,2020-08-20 10:17:27, Flipping the Class  is Garbage Pedagogy and Here s Why,id5oc8,2,5,Hello  there  At the time of writing this I am a graduate student  One  particular method of teaching that seems to be annoyingly popular in  college is the  flipping the class  option  Now the definition of this  method can go as follows     Flipping  the classroom  also known as  inverting  a classroom  is a    pedagogy first  approach to teaching in which course materials are   introduced outside of class  and in class time is re purposed for   inquiry  application  and assessment in order to better meet the needs   of individual learners  Course materials might include readings    pre recorded video lectures  using technology such as    Panopto      or research assignments  In class activities might involve helping   students work through course material individually and in groups  among   other active learning strategies for students to gain practice applying   knowledge gained prior to class      When  they say  materials are introduced outside of the classroom  what they  mean is that they are making the students teach themselves and then  quizzing them on how they regurgitate that information without knowing  what to specifically study beforehand  In other words   you are quizzed on materials not even covered in class yet    This is made even worse if the  materials  consist of the entire  chapter with all manner of things to memorize in a day to repeat back  the next class period   If you  confront a teacher about using this method  they almost always say that   studies have shown students retain information better this way  and  that  I want to get a better feel for where the class is with respect to  the material   But there are some substantial problems with this      Teacher Obsolescence     If  we are mainly supposed to teach ourselves the course then what is the  point of paying four figures for a teacher  Seriously  if we are  introducing the material to ourselves  then the teacher becomes a  glorified powerpoint translator and test proctor  Is the teacher not  supposed to help the students learn and not just set up hoops for them  to jump through  If the response is  the teacher helps facilitate  discussions and activities  then why don t we just look up interviews  from experts who actually work in the field for  discussions  and just  use older copies of textbooks and their  activities  FOR FREE instead of  bankrolling a bunch of teachers who like to dangle students  futures on  a string in front of them like it s all a game to them     Students pay for the teacher s ego and their curiosity     Because  teachers want a very accurate level of understanding of how much the  students really know  they artificially make the course more difficult   Now plenty of teachers will boast or brush this off saying  I make them  work for an A because I care    No  you don t  You are just acting like  an educational dominatrix by making people jump through your hoops  because it suits your ego and because you have one way you want everyone  to learn  more on that later   It isn t about you  it s about the  students and how best  they   learn  By forcing the students  who are by the way adults in college   you are being manipulative and jeopardizing people s futures just so you  can polish your apples and feel good about yourself being a  tough  teacher   The good teachers motivate the students to read the material  on their own by using their ability to reach students and to make the  material palatable  Flipping the classroom is tantamount to saying  Eh  it s your problem now  figure it out yourself  I m not responsible for  your education  when you are a freaking teacher  And if the only way you  can think to make students read is to penalize them for not doing so   instead of positively motivating them  then it means you are  substantially lacking as an educator  Because you re relying on the  stick and no carrot     Colleges  Promote and advertise student body diversity  Teachers  Demand everyone learn the same way     Colleges  and universities go out of their way to form diverse student bodies   Racially  spiritually  sexually  or otherwise  They say that they do  this to bring in many different perspectives to help create a better  learning environment  So when teachers used closed form pedagogy that  demands this super diverse group of students off numerous mindsets all  learn the same way  it is ignoring the fact that different people learn  best in different ways  This willful ignorance of the fact that students  have their own studying and learning techniques  that people don t  approach materials from different vantage points or have different  methods of learning that they ve developed since high school  No no   let s do the super time consuming method that only rich white kids will  have the time for and the method that only rich white kids who can  afford to let their GPA suffer if they falter a bit due to the  adjustment will have the means to do well in  There is no point in  gatekeeping at the academic level when industries have an certification  exam  ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU WILL BE ABLE TO STUDY HOWEVER YOU WANT FOR  THAT EXAM SINCE YOU RE OUT OF COLLEGE AT THAT POINT     These mind games will be pointless anyway     It  has been shown time and again that if you don t use information  you  lose it  Most of what you will actually need will be taught to you in  your job  because by the time the information gets to a college level   it s usually already obsolete  On top of that  the odds are good that  people will forget the materials of different classes throughout college  by the time they graduate  The entire thing is a farce of education   and holding people s feet to the fire over it doesn t help  It just  shows you have no pedagogical imagination beyond making a course harder   Now  there is no way in hell an educator is going to read this and agree  with me in whole or in part  Academics are notorious for being  impossible to reach when it comes to exposing something wrong with what  they do  They re utterly convinced of their own superiority and they  disdain any doubt or dismiss it as  juvenile misconception   But this  bullshit is going to be the death of them  and the funniest part is that  they are welcoming it with open arms  All while they torpedo the GPAs  and futures of their students just so they themselves can do less work  while looking like they care,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/id5oc8/flipping_the_class_is_garbage_pedagogy_and_heres/

rant,2020-08-19 18:51:29, Keese Love  is a violent scumbag  what he did is 100 percent indefensible ,icq8gw,16,7, Trigger Warning  Description of violence against LGBT persons   random Good Samaritan Motorists   Also my own opinions which will likely piss you off       This post is about Adam Haner  Keese Love  and the Trans woman who was attacked   It is not about Jordan Hollingsworth  the man who rolled over a motorcycle                                           Heyyyyy     Genuine question for the  Anarchists  of Reddit   Is anyone who _doesn t_ buy the established narrative that Adam Haner was just some evil White Nationalist trying to drive over protesters    a  Fascist      Hmm    I disagree strongly with your quick and lazy assessment of my character    You do not know me    I m _anything but_ a  fascist     I m as gay as the sun is bright    I voted for Bernie Sanders in 2016    I am most definitely  NOT  a Trump Supporter    I consider myself to be fairly damn liberal and I try to be a Tolerant Person but what I _don t_ tolerate is information manipulation and the twisting of  or the outright ignoring of  the truth in order to adhere to a carefully selected narrative    That video going around on YouTube of the Truck side confrontation between Keese Love and Adam Haner IS NOT the  start  of the incident  Although it s still bad    and nothing at all in that video justified what happened to Adam   There is in fact  another video  one that HASN T been shared as much  not on YouTube at least     I would share it here  but since it contains disturbing imagery and extreme violence as well as torture and blood  I will  refrain  from doing so  But if you check my comments elsewhere  you will probably spot a link to it   That particular video  the 8 minute Catbox link  starts from the point of time where Keese Love and his group approach a Transgender woman outside of a 711 and become hostile with her for no other reason than perhaps an offhand remark    In response  Keese Love threatens her  has people in his group beat her up  take her skateboard and back pack  And as she is being repeatedly struck in the ribs by multiple people at the same time  she says      I m not fighting back  I just want my backpack back  My ID is in there  if I don t have my ID I can t get back in my home  I m gunna sh   t myself in the effing head now because I won t be able to get back into my home     And at some point  Adam Haner  dude in the blue Transformers shirt  comes up to try to console this visibly distraught Transgender woman and protect her from the people who were beating her up    Keese and the rest of the group didn t like being obstructed by Haner so they took their anger out on him and his wife  That lead up to the frame of time where Adam is trying to get his wife into the truck so they can leave    Instead of being allowed to leave peacefully  his wife is shoved up against the side of the driver side door of the truck  she is struck in the face multiple times and as she is dizzy and trying to get away  another female member of the entourage runs at her and tackles her from behind  holding her on the ground and repeatedly swinging at her    Adam is clearly upset at the sight of his wife getting beaten up  The whole situation probably had him in a rush of adrenaline and fight or flight instincts  People are coming at his vehicle from the sides  kicking at it  one person breaks out a window with a metal baton    Some people are briefly in the front of his truck  he revs the engine a few times and the transmission grinds its gears  so maybe THAT scared them into thinking he might try to ram them  BUT HE DIDN T  He waited for a chance when nobody was in the direct path of the truck to actually leave  He also honked multiple times as an audible signal that he was going to be moving   The activity was occurring on the sides of the vehicle  NOT IN FRONT  One person did get a foot caught  but that person was pressing themselves up against the side of truck  Being right up against the side of a vehicle you KNOW is about to start moving is pretty much asking to get a foot rolled over  They made no effort to keep a safe distance from the side of the truck  They were right up on it   There is a pretty big difference between  this  kind of incident and someone deliberately driving at 70 MPH through a line of protesters who have locked hands across a busy highway   When Adam  Peels Off  he is only caring about one thing   getting out of the situation in one piece  He is so panic stricken that he crashes his truck somewhere down the road  and when Keese s group catch up to him they drag him out and start the whole process all over again  Yelling at him  Telling him to sit down on the ground   Adam is dizzy from the impact of wrecking his truck  dizzy from the fear  and dizzy from people knocking him backwards to the ground  His wife  who ran away from the wreck not wanting to be attacked again  calls Adam s phone  It s ringing and he asks the group standing over him  My wife is trying to call me  Can I answer it     While still sitting on the ground  Adam is kicked in the back of the head repeatedly  He is quick slapped in the face  repeatedly    Adam says  I wasn t tryna hurt nobody    Keese Love becomes enraged    he says  Fuck is yew mean  yew ain t tryna hurt nobody n   a   And keeps repeatedly hitting him in the face and swinging on Adam until another person physically pulls him away from him     From Keese s perspective and the perspective of the group  Adam was trying to  Run people over    but a reviewing of the ACTUAL FULL FOOTAGE shows that when he drove off  NO ONE was directly in the front path of his vehicle when he began moving  They were all at the sides  The one dude who got a foot caught under a tire had that foot caught BECAUSE they were not a safe distance from the side of the vehicle    And there was so much going on  and so many people around the vehicle that it s entirely possible the person just kicked the truck too hard and hurt themselves and it LOOKED like they got a foot ran over    OMG  WATCH YOUR FEET    Adam honked his horn MULTIPLE times to announce his intentions to move before actually trying to drive away  There was no one IN FRONT of his vehicle  as they were all attacking it from the sides    Back to the post crash stuff     At a seemingly peaceful moment    when Adam is just on the ground looking at his phone  presumably trying to text his wife to tell her he s okay  Keese Love gets a running start from behind and comes up and SWING KICKS ADAM IN THE SIDE OF THE FACE     This instantly knocks him unconscious and the group actually laughs about it  He was not even doing anything at the point in the moment that he was kicked    He was on the ground with his legs under him  in a PASSIVE  NON COMBATIVE STATE  He wasn t lunging at anyone with a weapon  he wasn t making loud threats to do grievous bodily harm to anyone    He was simply looking at his phone   Keese Love kicked the man in the face for no good reason  And even if Adam had been  muttering racial slurs under his breath      as Keese s longtime friend and personal YouTube comment section white knight  Mobidyfid  claimed in a now deleted comment on one of the videos being spread   that s STILL not a good reason to kick someone when they are completely NON COMBATIVE    Systemic Racism  isn t an excuse to be a violent hyper aggressive douchebag to people who aren t even trying to fight you      Keese  believing he had  accidentally  murdered the man  posted to his Instagram  I might go to jail tonight for murder when all I did was fight a racist     Kicking someone in the face when they aren t even aware of your approach is not  fighting  someone  that is being a coward and attacking someone for no other reason than because you felt like it    Adam Haner survived the brutal attack  so Keese Love won t be hit with a murder charge  but there s already a manhunt underway by Portland Police who want to bring him in for questioning   Keese will more than likely go on the run     I didn t and STILL DON T buy the established narrative that Adam Haner was some evil White Nationalist just out looking to pick a fight with protesters  the video going back to when the Transgender person was being harassed and attacked shows Adam was just trying to help    _HOW MANY_ White Nationalists or Racist Extremists will stop to try and help a Trans person    I somehow doubt the number of those who _WOULD_ is all that high considering a good lot of them  hate  lgtb people      And anyone who has any other opinion than  Adam Haner was a racist bad guy who deserved what he got  gets called a  Fascist    That word is becoming so watered down and over used that it is beginning to lose its meaning     Adam was not some aggressive Proud Boy standing around and waving a Rebel Flag or threatening to stab people  He was just a random dude who was in the wrong place at the wrong time    Fascist  Yeah    How about some actual _proof_  please  And your quick judgements are not proof  3rd hand accounts are not evidence  I can  say  anything I want about you  but until I have actual proof that I can show  it is merely a quickly formed opinion   Also    I think that  Fascist  and  Racist  are just fast and easy buzz words that can be used to quickly de humanize the other person without having to use any critical thinking   When you look at the video footage that is being shared now  what difference at all is there between Keese and his friends playing Judge  Jury   Executioner and the Police doing the same kind of thing to somebody else  I mean aside from the obvious difference of the Police having GUNS    Keese Love didn t NEED a gun when his foot and running momentum could have easily caused Adam Haner to DIE or at the very least  go comatose and be laid up in a hospital for a very long time  You likely will say  Good  That s what a racist deserves   but where is the proof that he is in fact a racist  What    A meme he shared about Cannon Hinnant  That s your proof           This incident doesn t matter  and the police have more numbers than we do    I d say a group of about 20 to 30 people or more outnumbers ONE guy and his wife   You re scared of Police in riot gear roughing you up and macing you or clubbing you  well this guy was probably pretty damn scared of the crowd surrounding his vehicle and being verbally and physically hostile towards him    He was a drunk     Well alright then  that s entirely possible  but again like the Nazi accusations  I need some  PROOF  first before I ll buy that excuse    Where s his toxicology report  And even if he WAS drunk  that excuses absolutely  NO PART  of the events that transpired in the videos being circulated   Go find and watch the real  Full Video  going back to the initial confrontation between Keese and the Transgender woman  Not the one that starts out with Adam trying to help his wife get back into his Truck so they can leave the situation     Adam Haner  only  got involved because he saw someone being unfairly harassed and attacked    Sorry if the next statement I make is harsh or offensive to you     but it appears to me that Transgender Lives don t actually matter to the Cult of Social Justice  when  the circumstances mean that it might make a Person of Color look bad     The Tumblr SJWs who love to rip people apart for the slightest grievances  and talk a big game about  Intersectionality  and  We re All In This Together  and like to Reblog and Hashtag about how  Trans Rights Are Human Rights  most likely wouldn t say one unflattering thing about Keese Love and his buddies  simply because  He s a Person of Color  and that means he has  automatic  immunity from criticism or personal responsibility for his actions   I can already hear the excuses being made     Oh    well that Transgender woman probably must ve called him a racial slur  I mean nobody would just beat up a Trans person for no reason  right    And that Adam Haner guy tried to run people over  And yeah he s probably like  a White Nationalist or a Proud Boy or something      Anything at all to justify your own cognitive dissonance  I don t think the SocJus Cult really truly cares about LGBT people if it can just brush something like this under the rug and forget that it ever happened   I don t think Social Justice Warriors actually care about _real_ justice  They just want to follow the script that was written for them  never rock the boat   especially if the situation involves PoC  and if anyone ever tries to share a different opinion about something and we don t like their opinion   just call them a Racist  or a Fascist  or an anything phobe until their voice is silenced     All Cops Are Bastards  gets said quite a lot    It s understandable    people get so angry at the constant deaths or abuse of PoC at the hands of Police that they will totally agree with the idea that there are  No Good Cops     The system is set up so that cops get away with anything if they have the right friends and it s  rare  that anyone within Law Enforcement speaks out against their own   But      Nobody says  All Protesters Are Bastards  do they     No    Because we give _individual_ people  within those groups the benefit of a doubt and say that  A few violent assholes in the movement aren t representative of the whole    Interesting logic    and it gets applied _very_ selectively     I don t think  A P A B   but I think it s outright hypocrisy to not hold individuals within your groups accountable for what they do  simply out of Protester Loyalty   When Keese or some other individual does something that is indefensibly BAD  like attack a Trans woman  or run up and kick a man in the face who isn t prepared for  or even TRYING to have a fight   they are not held to the same kind of standard as we would hold Police  That s somehow  different    cops attacking citizens is super super bad  but citizens attacking citizens is just peachy   We throw an absolute fit if a Cop temporarily shuts off his Body Cam  But we re totally fine when the people organizing these protests  like Keese s buddy  D C    instruct their personal Press NOT to record the fights    I thought Press was supposed to record anything and _everything_ so that the viewer gets a full and UN manipulated scope of the events that take place   I mean    members of Cop Block orgs always record Police Interactions  REGARDLESS  of what s going on at any given moment  so in the event something DOES happen  it s caught on video and able to be spread and analyzed   If D C  doesn t want his  Press  to record fights  isn t that the same thing as a cop shutting off his body cam so he can beat the crap out of someone without worrying about the footage being reviewed later by his higher ups  Is the hypocrisy here just not graspable enough     And thank friggin  hell  multiple  individuals serving the function of  Press  disobeyed those orders from their higher ups  or we would not have gotten either the footage of the Trans woman being beaten up  or the Truck side footage where Adam and his wife are physically attacked      If your Orgs have  any  integrity at all  they will happily and voluntarily police their own members just as much as they  want  to police the Police    And just so you understand  I am  not  justifying any of what Police have been doing to the protestors in  any  state  So don t be hitting me up with some  bootlicker  ad hominem nonsense      I am talking about  Keese  here  Ok   Also  let me repeat      ANGER isn t a justification for unwarranted violence upon a person who is NOT being hostile or combative    If a cop beats someone up simply because he was irritated and pissed off and  Just caught up in the frenzy of the moment  we don t let that slide for them  so why let it slide for someone like Keese Love    I don t care what words that Trans woman was using  IF she even did    I don t care what words Adam Haner was using  IF he even did    The REAL  Full Video  is circulating    and neither the Trans woman or Adam sound like they re just dropping N bombs left and right or going out of their way to be hostile    The only people I hear dropping non stop N bombs is Keese   Friends   The only people I see being physically threatening and hostile are Keese   Friends   The REAL  Full Video  is going around and it will KEEP going around  and this narrative can NO LONGER BE CONTROLLED    D C   really  thought that he was doing a great job intimidating the Freelance Antifa Press to be willing pawns and not record this evidence of an unwarranted attack  But even the COOL people in Antifa were like  Nope  Record button go PING                   One of my friends  who is a Furry and also participates in Antifa  like    actually attends their events   tried to rationalize this attack by pointing at memes on Adam Haber s Facebook page    I love my friend to death  but he s a bit blind to the fact that his opinion is being shaped purely by third hand accounts and NOT actual video evidence  That s what being BRAINWASHED by SocJus will do to you   I do not care one little bit about what memes were on Adam s Facebook page  it is irrelevant  It does not justify the attack     That s the same type of pitiful  Past Digging  as what people tried doing to Abed Arberry to justify his death  His past is not relevant at all to what happened to him  Adam s FB page content and past activities are also irrelevant to any of what happened to him    You can t use Adam s FB content or his personal political leanings to justify a single second of what Keese Love did  It is straight up reprehensible and it has no excuse or defense      end rant                                              ADDENDUM      Keese Love attempted to make a GoFundMe for himself to get some money for  fighting a Racist   It was only up for mere seconds   Absolutely hilarious    At least he knows his audience   By the way  there is a 32 minute long video on YouTube that appears to start around a park  the individual they are harassing is someone different  as the first guy has a plain blue shirt and patterned shorts  Adam was wearing a blue Transformers shirt and plain shorts  The first

rant,2020-08-20 07:49:14,Why do people even like nintendo  They Have extremely poor product quality and a very limited auDiEnce and genre of games ,id3xph,1,8,I get people liking classic Nintendo  as classic Nintendo did some things right  not as much as Atari  SEGA  or even NEC  but still had some pretty good games and hardware for the time  But what I don t get is people liking modern Nintendo  like every home console they ve made after the N64 has been utterly worthless compared to the competition  Not only did after the PlayStation   Saturn came out did all their major third party franchises jump ship  Metal Gear  Final Fantasy  Contra  Castlevania  etc  but the hardware also greatly suffered  The N64 only had half the total processing power of the PlayStation  and was only BARELY on par with the saturn  but not by too much  The Saturn had some of the best fighting games ever made  the Playstation revolutionized the racing and stealth genres  and straight up invented survival horror altogether  What did the N64 have  A bunch of kids party games and wonky platformers  That s not much diversity  The system has only a handful of 2d action games  and NO TURN BASED RPGs to be seen   The next generation was even more pathetic for Nintendo  The Xbox absolutely DESTROYED the GameCube  and the PlayStation absolutely destroyed the Xbox in Asian territories  While the Xbox had tons of classics like Conker  Live and Reloaded  war thunder  steel battalion  Call of Duty 4  Fusion Frenzy  Mercenaries  Star Wars Battlefront I   II  Blinx Timesweeper  Dead or Alive  Puyo Pop Fever  Crazy Taxi  and of course  Halo  Combat evolved    and the PlayStation 2 had Ratchet   Clank  Final Fantasy X  Gran Turismo  Soul Calibur  Resident Evil  Metal Gear 3 and Time Crisis   But what did the GameCube have  Once again  little disveristy in games  Super Mario Sunshine  a game which played like molasses and had a lackluster attempt at open world and platforming  Super Smash Bros Melee  a fun game for parties or tournaments  albeit one where the novelty wears off fast  Pokemon XD  Gale of Darkness  which I have nothing bad to say about  it s one of the best and most unique Pokémon games in the entire series  and Starfox Adventures  which is pretty fun  albeit feeling kinda lacking in the longevity of content   So I m extremely disappointed and always been consistently underwhelmed by Nintendo  I was so underwhelmed by the N64  that I asked my parents to return it to the store and exchange it for a PlayStation less than 2 weeks in  I got a SEGA Saturn not too long after  and I have no regrets  I haven t touched any Nintendo console but the GB C  DS 3DS Switch since  The Wii just looked to childish and lacking in games  the Wii U just looked like a straight up waste of money  I never got around to buying the GBA due to me having to penny pinch  and the GameCube looked wimpy in comparison to the Xbox   I ve switched to Xbox since it came out and gotten much greater satisfaction than the equivalent Nintendo consoles of that generation  Sony is alright  but I hate their business model and their UI is always dated and clunky  running worse than Android 3 0 from decades ago  Sony has some pretty cool games though  but the Wii Wii U  I just saw poor quality ports and again  underpowered hardware and lack of diversity in games   A lot of people think I m stupid for liking Xbox over Nintendo  but really  I know I m not alone  Is there anyone else out there who hasn t liked any newer Nintendo consoles  Cause they just remind me of how Atari and SEGA stopped making consoles  and that is a damn shame considering the market  I bought the Jaguar in around 2003 and it s a sad story cause the system has a ton of potential  Even I barely knew about it s existence cause the PlayStation absolutely smothered it   Has anyone else had a similar experience  If so  did you give up after the N64  Or did you wait till one of the following generations to do so,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/id3xph/why_do_people_even_like_nintendo_they_have/

rant,2020-08-20 00:31:34,Ranting about my childhood and my ex and my mental health ,icwx9k,1,0, My childhood    When I grew up I only ever had 2 friends at a time at maximum  There were these 2 girls  1 of which I was only friends with because of the other  both of which bossed me around and were pretty rude for like 5    year olds  Eventually when the kinder one moved away I was left alone because the ruder friend left me for a group of girls so I was left alone for however long that was    My memory this far back is very fuzzy and jumbled up    I recall hanging around with my brother and cousins for a majority of my junior school because I was incapable of making friends and felt bad about leaving them behind  and also because I felt like they would judge my new friends for whatever reason so I was afraid for stupid reasons also    Being the oldest out of all of them I would always move into older schools first and be left alone  so due to my lacking of social skills I started following around this guy in my year and trying to involve myself as best as I could  despite never being accepted into the friend group so I just followed them all around like a leech parasite    Around 10 years old I made a  friend  who was obsessed with pokemon  It was literally the only thing he talked about ever ever  Which wasn t bad because I also liked pokemon  but it seemed he _only_ liked pokemon  I would leave my lessons for break lunch time only for him to wander over to me to talk about pokemon and it drove me nuts inside  but I didn t want to tell him due to fears of losing the closest person I had outside of my family  The entire time I was just waiting for the bliss of him leaving because he was in the year ahead so I couldn t wait to be free of the repetitiveness of all my free time    When the next school year started I was left alone as my cousins moved to another school and my brother had his own seperate friend group  I recall a memory of me being perplexed and working up the courage to ask my brother  how do you have so many friends    I don t remember his response  likely for the better lol  Anyway  during my time at this school I developed a crush on a girl and tried to get to know her by looking at her from across the classroom and not talking to her aha  Fortunately I was acquaintances with her friends  but due to my insecurities I never tried to get too close because I knew feared they always spoke of me as I was the only boy out of them all  so I literally distanced myself despite wanting to get to know them    This entire time period I had people that disliked me  That bullied me  I can recall all of their names recount all the things they called me  and all the things they threw at me during classes  I remember all the times they broke me down into tears in the middle of a classroom and how I was so shy that I simply tried to hide it  except it was obvious every time because the people around would always get so awkward and not want to talk about the quiet boy that was crying    The bullies and cunts were different people every few years  from around 5 to 15 years old is my guess  I remember asking one of the bullies at some point  why do you all pick on me all the time   and I was answered simply with  I don t know  we just do   That memory will never leave me    After I moved to secondary school I hung around the only kid I knew of that didn t bully me  yet was also a loud irritating prick constantly pissing off the people around him with weird noises and an obsession with minecraft and the likes  Through him however I became part of a larger friend group 2 years or so latrer  to which I was the brunt of the litter  There were 2 kids that constantly picked on me and would fuck around with my lunch and throw shit at me during my free periods  I couldn t internalise all of that anger daily and eventually I snapped  but being the non violent person I am I just made a fool of myself and ran away to which one of my teachers found me and let me hide in his class  Embarrassment ensued as my crush  a different person now  and all the other people in my year would have to walk past to go to their classes and look in on me crying alone    Looking back now at this stuff  it s no wonder I snapped so often at my brother s friend  I feel bad for upsetting him often  however I was truly oblivious the entire time as he too would hide away whenever he cried    Out of the larger friend group I was a part of  I made a true friend that I am still in contact with to this day  and he has told me that he feels bad for all the tormenting I went through from the 2 other kids    After secondary school I started college and started studying 3 miserable subjects  maths physics and further maths  I had the chance of choosing resistant materials  where you build projects and document them  which I know I would have loved because I had previously aced that same subject in my older school  however because I was so pressured when being asked on what I wanted to take I picked further maths  and I hated every minute of it    For the first few months I had no friends besides a few girls I knew from my old crush  who d have thought  and some guys in my further maths group  I wasn t particularly close to any of these people  and the daily grind of misery was horrid  Learn subjects I don t enjoy  with teachers I didn t like  and spend my free time with people that felt like a chore to be with    Later on I was lucky enough to befriend 2 guys who I consider to be 2 of my best friends to this day  but at the time sadly I only saw them as reminders of college and didn t develop our friendships that much over the entirety first year that I was there    After this year  my 2 friends from further maths stopped studying further maths and I had nobody in my class to talk to  in a class of around 15  Everyone else already had their own friend groups and I was isolated alone  barely getting by with my lack of socialising skills    On one hand  I was getting on very well with my 2 new friends and enjoying all my spare time  On the other hand  I was doing terribly in my subjects for the first time ever  Where previously I was top of the class constantly and not being the best hurt me deeply to the point of tears  For the entire 2 years that I was there  despite my constant efforts at studying I was getting worse and worse grades  My physics teacher mocked me in front of another teacher and one of my friends for 2 ridiculous errors in one of my exams  My friend still remembers this  and while it is funny to look back on  it was really a very rude thing for him to have done in such a mocking way  My maths teacher wasn t helping much by telling me to go for the  low hanging fruit  and not much more  and my further maths teacher was telling me for the entire last year about my improvement and when it got to the week before the exam she literally told me not to take it because she was so certain I would fail    She knew it  I knew it    I remember the feeling of dread as I read my exams thinking  I ve seen this before  I have no idea how to do it though   and just giving it my best shot  I pushed through with all of my exams and passed everything  getting the lowest grade in further maths available and getting moderate at best grades in everything else    I was super lucky to have even made it into university  I didn t get into any of my 5 options and had to study an extra year this year to compensate for my grades  yet I made it  not including the single exam I have to retake this summer             her    I met a girl online almost exactly 2 years ago as of now    I met her half way through college through a mutual online friend  We became close friends and messaged and called each other daily from the start  hitting it off perfectly  Coincidence or not  I met her while I was in the middle of college  One could say I  needed  her because of my lack of relationship experience  and simply my general lack of friendships at the time  To this day my friends blame her and the game we d play together for the poor grades I got    During the entire time I knew her  she was always the one I would be talking to at almost any point  I looked past her flaws and the red flags and painted a picture in my mind of who I thought she was  I was putting up with her stubborn ass daily  and how she  hated to repeat herself  which is fair enough  but given my poor listening talking skills a lot of conversations just went over my head    Regardless  we eventually developed strong enough feelings for each other and so we eventually went out of our ways to meet up in person little under a year ago  so pretty much after we d known each other for a year    We both took up summer jobs to pay for my travel costs and I spent about 2 3 months working in a restaurant to get the money I needed  I travelled across europe in almost a 24 hour journey by car ride  2 trains and a plane  she was from a rather separated city   We connect naturally and have a good time together and get intimate over the nights and I even got to meet her friends and have meals with her mum  We went to a party together  I had my first kiss with her  we got drunk together and the lot   After I return home I had to travel to university for the first time ever and to live alone  and it was around this time that she had seemingly cut all contact with me and wouldn t return any of my messages or calls  which was a huge contrast to the year straight daily phone calls messages face times we exchanged   To this day I have no idea why she did this and I can t shake it off my mind  just the idea that I spent all that time and energy getting to know her and all the moments we shared together lead to nothing    She began contact again on literally christmas day  that is 3 months after we lost contact and in the moment I was filled with relief that I just accepted contact and carried on for another month or 2  During this entire time period I was pissed off at myself for ignoring the 3 months of silence and her for putting me through it    I finally mustered the courage to explain that I was unhappy and I told how angry I was at being put through 3 months of silence after moving into some where new without contact with  the person who meant the most to me     To this day  since that conversation  we have had almost no contact with each other and whenever we do cross she acts as if nothing happened  I can t stand it    She torments my mind on a daily basis and just the thought of her pisses me off  It pisses me off that I still have her on my mind after all this time  It pisses me off that she pisses me off  It feels like it s been long enough that it s silly to bring up my struggles with my friends family           Mental health    At some point in secondary school my friend started the idea of mental health by introducing me to the topic of ADHD  saying if it had ever occurred to me that I could have it  I resonated with the symptoms deeply and so I brought it up with my parents  They took me as being a silly  overly scared child and brushed it off  however I pestered them enough with my concerns and my mum took me to the GP where I was barely even involved with the conversation that went on  It was simply shut down and put down to  exam stress   I was pissed off at my inability to speak up and control the conversation    Thankfully I used my anger and used it as a fuel and started taking note of my symptoms and examples in the 2 years since  I was able to conclude logically that the problem was not exam stress because I was still experiencing the symptoms in time periods where there were not exams at all  Over time I had taken many many notes of symptoms and so when I moved out alone I was finally in control of how things were in my life    After procrastinating joining a GP I finally worked up the courage to go outside and do it  It took about a month in total to officially join      I booked an appointment at the GP and was told to come back next week for another GP to see me  I was told my symptoms sounded like ADHD  Autism and Bipolar and was told to come back next week for another GP to see me  I was told my symptoms lined up with ADHD  anxiety and depression and was referred to an autism centre and for a blood test  That part took about 2 weeks      I was then referred for a piss test  That also took 2 weeks      Then the Austim centre finally sent out the various forms surveys  That took another 2 weeks for filling in  returning  waiting  filling and returning again      Turns out that I do not have autism  Then I was referred to a psychiatrist  Hurrah    And then COVID 19 struck  Appointment cancelled    I phone up  what can I do for my appointment     Thankfully I can have a phone call appointment in a months time    I waited out the months time period and woke up in time  eagerly waiting for the phone to ring    And there was no phone call  My memory is foggy here  however I remember I had to wait another week for a phone call for whatever reason  I list off my general symptoms and tell of my concerns of ADHD and I am to have a booked appointment in January 2021  D   meaning that  as of the start of this ADHD journey I have had to wait an entire year for my first appointment    I ve heard of worse but good grief this is killing me inside  with my mum trying to brush off the whole idea and my dad as nonchalant to this whole idea  as he is for every other concern of mine      This sums up pretty much everything that bothers me right now that floats inside my head  aside from my irritating and distant family  There isn t much to say about them  except for the overall lack of closeness and emotional support  but I have my friends now for that      I m trying my best  I m sorry if I sound like a whiny bitch  I just have constantly have anger bottled inside me that I have learned to contain over my life  There are other things too but they re just fluttering thoughts in my head that I lose within an instant  I hate raging over my life like this  I never complain IRL because I know other people have so much worse  But at the same time I feel like I too have it pretty bad  but having this comparison feeling feels so unjust      Tl Dr  Shitty

rant,2020-08-19 09:04:23,Literature classes are dogshit and easily worse than all of the other common core subjects ,ici77r,6,1,I love some good writing  I love texts with deeper meaning  I like a lot of poetry  I see nothing wrong with trying to teach any of this  and I think it s all very interesting  My view on this has changed drastically from a couple of years ago  when I couldn t have cared less  But I definitely appreciate it now   What I DON T like is when an English class forces you to read some book that is terribly written and then makes you talk about how great it is  Not all books are actually  deep  or  meaningful   In fact  most of them aren t  So why do they ALWAYS pick the most shallow books that parrot the same 3 topics and sound like they are written by a 5th grader with a thesaurus   What makes a book  powerful  to someone is incredibly subjective  It is incredibly annoying when someone is making you write about how great something is when you do not agree with it at all  It s completely disingenuous and takes away from the whole point of analyzing texts   Finding the deeper meaning  no longer becomes actually analyzing the text to see how certain themes or moods are conveyed  it becomes a painful process of trying to bullshit through the whole thing in the most shallow way possible  None of this is important  None of this is interesting  Nobody gives a shit about any of this  It is no more than a chore  because of how we are forced to conform to one idea  Any essay just becomes a whole bunch of paragraphs making up a bunch of shit to try and satisfy the requirement instead of actually writing about meaningful things   I ask all of my old classmates  ALL of them  about this one book we are reading  Not a single person enjoys any of it  It s not just boring  it is just terribly written  Despite this we all have to jack off the author for their  aMaZiNg wRiTiNg  every ten pages or so  Any joy in analyzing literature is completely sucked out in literature classes because free thinking is eliminated and it s all about trying to satisfy whatever the teacher wants you to say   By having all of these dumb fucking requirements  any concept of depth in literature classes is eliminated  No  you can t deviate from the essay template you used 5 years ago to talk about actually interesting concepts  that would make too much sense  You have to repeat the same thing over and over because creativity and analytical thinking is actively punished in the most ironic way possible   TLDR  Literature classes actively punishing actual analytical thinking because it just becomes a chore of trying to figure out what satisfies the teacher the most  It s not interesting  it s not meaningful  and nobody is genuine in what they write  because it is designed to make all of those things impossible,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/ici77r/literature_classes_are_dogshit_and_easily_worse/

now  I put together a quick Q A  with questions from a hypothetical person with misconceptions and answers from the perspective of an AP U S  History Teacher   Q  What did the Confederacy stand for   A  Rather than interpreting  let s go directly to the words of the Confederacy s Vice President  Alexander Stephens  In his  Cornerstone Speech  on March 21  1861  he stated  The Constitution    rested upon the equality of races  This was an error  Our new government is founded upon exactly the opposite idea  its foundations are laid  its corner stone rests  upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man  that slavery subordination to the superior race is his natural and normal condition  This  our new government  is the first  in the history of the world  based upon this great physical  philosophical  and moral truth    Q  But people keep saying heritage  not hate  They think the purpose of the flags and monuments are to honor confederate soldiers  right   A  The vast majority of confederate flags flying over government buildings in the south were first put up in the 1960 s during the Civil Rights Movement  So for the first hundred years after the Civil War ended  while relatives of those who fought in it were still alive  the confederate flag wasn t much of a symbol at all  But when Martin Luther King  Jr  and John Lewis were marching on Washington to get the Civil Rights Act  1964  and Voting Rights Act  1965  passed  leaders in the south felt compelled to fly confederate flags and put up monuments to honor people who had no living family members and had fought in a war that ended a century ago  Their purpose in doing this was to exhibit their displeasure with black people fighting for basic human rights that were guaranteed to them in the 14th and 15th Amendments but being withheld by racist policies and practices   Q  But if we take down confederate statues and monuments  how will we teach about and remember the past   A  Monuments and statues pose little educational relevance  whereas museums  the rightful place for Confederate paraphernalia  can provide more educational opportunities for citizens to learn about our country s history  The Civil War is important to learn about  and will always loom large in social studies curriculum  Removing monuments from public places and putting them in museums also allows us to avoid celebrating and honoring people who believed that tens of millions of black Americans should be legal property   Q  But what if the Confederate flag symbol means something different to me   A  Individuals aren t able to change the meaning of symbols that have been defined by history  When I hang a Bucs flag outside my house  to me  the Bucs might represent the best team in the NFL  but to the outside world  they represent an awful NFL team  since they haven t won a playoff game in 18 years  I can t change that meaning for everyone who drives by my house because it has been established for the whole world to see  If a Confederate flag stands for generic rebellion or southern pride to you  your personal interpretation forfeits any meaning once you display it publicly  as its meaning takes on the meaning it earned when a failed regime killed hundreds of thousands of Americans in an attempt to destroy America and keep black people enslaved forever   Q  But my uncle posted a meme that said the Civil War Confederacy was about state s rights and not slavery   A   A state s right to what     John Green  Q  Everyone is offended about everything these days  Should we take everything down that offends anyone   A  The Confederacy literally existed to go against the Constitution  the Declaration of Independence  and the idea that black people are human beings that deserve to live freely  If that doesn t upset or offend you  you are un American   Q  Taking these down goes against the First Amendment and freedom of speech  right   A  No  Anyone can do whatever they want on their private property  on their social media  etc  Taking these down in public  or having private corporations like NASCAR ban them on their properties  has literally nothing to do with the Bill of Rights   Q  How can people claim to be patriotic while supporting a flag that stood for a group of insurgent failures who tried to permanently destroy America and killed 300 000 Americans in the process   A  No clue   Q  So if I made a confederate flag my profile picture  or put a confederate bumper sticker on my car  what am I declaring to my friends  family  and the world   A  That you support the Confederacy  To recap  the Confederacy stands for  slavery  white supremacy  treason  failure  and a desire to permanently destroy Selective history as it supports white supremacy   It s no accident that   You learned about Helen Keller instead of W E B  DuBois  You learned about the Watts and L A  Riots  but not Tulsa or Wilmington   You learned that George Washington s dentures were made from wood  rather than the teeth from slaves   You learned about black ghettos  but not about Black Wall Street   You learned about the New Deal  but not  red lining    You learned about Tommie Smith s fist in the air at the 1968 Olympics  but not that he was sent home the next day and stripped of his medals   You learned about  black crime   but white criminals were never lumped together and discussed in terms of their race   You learned about  states rights  as the cause of the Civil War  but not that slavery was mentioned 80 times in the articles of secession   Privilege is having history rewritten so that you don t have to acknowledge uncomfortable facts   Racism is perpetuated by people who refuse to learn or acknowledge this reality   You have a choice    Jim Golden

rant,2020-08-18 20:21:10,The death sentence,ic5bk9,2,5,First of all  I hate having to post here  Can t post my thoughts anywhere else or it will get removed  I can comment all I want  but if I make a topic somewhere it gets removed instantly  Anyways   The death penalty  The most serious reply from civilized society to a crime committed against it  At least that what it s supposed to be  In our country it has become a thing to abhor and avoid  Even the WORST OFFENDERS often get life in prison  or less  The people that we send to death row sit there for years and years  even after their  appeals  go through  which has always been the excuse for keeping them for so long   Why  Because of money  It makes WAY more money to house a POS for 10 years than it does to put him to death the moment his appeals are through    States have been doing everything they can to execute as few people as they can  because it makes them money   The prisons system LOBBIES for HARSHER MANDATORY MINIMUMS but lobbies AGAINST the death penalty  Why  Money of course   There s a dude in death row  right now  that killed his wife and his daughter  and then tried to kill his two sons but was too much of a fuck up to even kill two small children    so what did he do  He marched them back to the bedroom and showed them their mother and sister  Showed them    and then attacked them again but luckily they somehow made it next door  This man CONFESSED and had NO INTEREST in appeals beyond that which was mandatory  He knows he deserves to die    and yet they keep him alive year after year as he makes money for the state  The surviving boys  that were children at the time are now young men  The man that slaughtered their mother and sister and ruined their lives gets 3 squares a day   gets to read   gets to think     We let this happen   Nobody wants people to die or be harmed  but there are people who need to be   The rich are the only people who benefit from this   The family of victims should be involved  if they want  in the execution of the perpetrator   I think executions should be done in public   I think executions should be HORRIBLY PAINFUL AND SLOW   What deterrent is sitting on death row for 10  years     just to be killed in a painless way   How about we put them on a pike after we flay every bit of their skin off  Shit  I wouldn t do anything that might get me that    shiiiiit     I ve seen so many victims whose lives were ruined who got no closure or retribution     why aren t they allowed to at least pull the switch     I m about to start a subreddit called  if I ruled the world ,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/ic5bk9/the_death_sentence/
