Electricity,2020-08-08 12:46:03,Question about the calculation,i5wjm1,1,2, Hi guys  I m writing an article about RV power consumption and how much batteries are needed   I found this website   that gives an example of how to calculate your power consumption and how many batteries you need   This is pretty complex for me as I don t know anything about watts  amp  amp hours and so on  Before I write about it  I wanna make sure that it s correct   I would really appreciate it if you guys could give me your opinion about it     I ll just copy paste the text below   Example   Total appliances running at the same time including the surge is 3600  watts but the running watts are only 2000 watts  You would get an inverter that is 3600   1 20   4320 watts  Obviously  we don t have a  4320 watt inverter so we would recommend a 5000 watt   Your continuous  running amp draw is 2000 watts 12DC   166DC amps   you don t want to install a 5 000 watt inverter if the 166DC amps needed to supply it will run down your batteries in 30 minutes   To estimate your anticipated power consumption  take the current  166 DC  amps  and multiply by the number of hours per day that you expect to use it  Let s say you will run 2000 watts  166 DC amps for a total of 2  hours per day  You will need 166  2 hours   332 amps total    You will also want to check the efficiency of the RV  inverter that you are  selecting  Because the process of converting from 12 VDC to 120 VAC  generates heat  the inverter will always draw more watts from the batteries than it can deliver  Some brands have greater losses than others  usually 8 10     If you have a battery bank of 400  amps  you will be able to run your 2000  watts for 1 2 hours but we don t recommend fully depleting your battery bank  Take your total available battery amps of 400 and divide by your total amp need of 332 and you get  1 2 hours  400 332  1 2 amp hours    We recommend no less than 50 depth of discharge  If you follow this recommendation you will get 1 2 hours      50      6 hours of run time,https://www.reddit.com/r/Electricity/comments/i5wjm1/question_about_the_calculation/

Electricity,2020-06-24 21:44:04,Struggling with excessive heat in office during summer  management refuses to install A C  which are in other offices  stating that it will require adding a circuit breaker otherwise the A C will blow a fuse  Can I get some feedback on this situation ,hf6qq1,1,6,I work in a supportive living facility and my small office    150 200sqft  is located on the third floor sandwiched between two resident suites  The configuration used to be one large suite so they added walls to separate into 3 spaces  I share an office with 2 other people  not every day though  but when all 3 of us are in there on a warmer summer day it gets brutally hot   I had asked about A C last year and was rejected based on   1  The rooms used to be one big room  so because it s all been separated adding an A C unit would draw too much power and blow a fuse 2  The only solution would be to install a whole new breaker or something along those lines  I m not great with electrical stuff   which would be too     3  Combine cost to install new breaker and install A C  it s all too much     x200B   Our office is pretty well the only one without A C and we are the only one on the third floor  The suites next to us don t have much for electrical plugged in   left room has a radio  right room has TV cable box and oxygen machine running  Our office has 1 window which doesn t get too much direct sunlight but still enough that it requires shutting the blinds  We have 2  floor fans which help a bit but not on a very hot day with all of us in the office  The nature of our job means we are not in the office all day  but there are times i may need to do computer work for an hour or two  or am doing paperwork  planning  etc which requires sitting at my desk for extended periods of time   Our on site maintenance guy said he didn t think A C would blow a fuse  He spoke with another maintenance man at our sister building who said it would  He said he can talk to his higher management on Monday if we d like  although I m unsure as I don t want to get myself and my staff in trouble for questioning stuff   I had found 2 A C window units online under  150 at 5000 BTU  115V  each with an energy rating of 11 or so  I figure these are fine for the space  one of them I believe had a wattage listing of   530  We don t really have much plugged in besides phone chargers  laptop and tablet charger  and our fan  The outlets look like this        x200B   If I m correct in my understanding of the situation based on the above info and a bit of Google  the electrical components that exist  which would be the exact same throughout the building  as it makes no sense that it would differ up here especially as there are other offices that were built from converted suites  are not high enough amperage to accommodate a small A C unit  Breakers can be replaced from 15A to 20A  as can the outlets  but there may need to be wiring changed if the wires are not suitable for this switch  If all of these switches were to occur  then a 5000 BTU 115V A C should not cause a fuse to blow     x200B   So    is this whole concept actually excessively expensive  Or is management just being cheap  I had to get my office chair replaced with an actual ergonomic one due to a recent car accident  and even then they haven t bought the other desk equipment I had said I d benefit from  not expensive either  and I ll be buying them myself  And they had to replace our internet router because the internet was always dying and I had to use the computer in other offices  which defeats the purpose of setting up the desk ergonomically  internet has been terrible since I started last January  and it was only replaced because of my car accident despite numerous complaints repeatedly     but like  f  ck if the office is like 30 Celsius then why would I stay to do any computer work      x200B   ETA there are 4 or 5 outlets in the office  although there may be one or two more hidden by furniture     x200B     TL DR   Management is saying that the way my office is designed I can t get an A C installed because it will blow a fuse and it would be too expensive to add a new circuit breaker etc to prevent this  I received a different response from our on site maintenance man  Is it actually that expensive to upgrade an outlet and circuit breaker from 15A to 20A  which I assume is needed for a small 5000 BTU 115V A C unit ,https://www.reddit.com/r/Electricity/comments/hf6qq1/struggling_with_excessive_heat_in_office_during/

Electricity,2020-05-18 23:23:32,Strange current draw from high voltage power supply ,gm9dqz,2,9,I have a high voltage supply with a microwave oven transformer  and I am attempting to limit the current to the transformer by wiring a 200uF capacitor in series with the primary winding  This should be giving me 13 2629 ohms of resistance  which should limit the transformers current draw to around 9 Amps    The problem is that when the transformer is powered  unless the secondary is short circuited the current draw of the transformer ticks over 19 amps until the breaker trips  Why would the current draw be so high when the reactance of the capacitors should only allow the transformer to draw 9 amps  And why does the circuit take 19  Amps from the wall when there is no load on the transformer   Also  when there is no load on the transformer a loud humming sound can be heard  when the transformer is short circuited the current draw goes back to normal and the transformer becomes quiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/Electricity/comments/gm9dqz/strange_current_draw_from_high_voltage_power/

Electricity,2020-05-16 02:34:57,I don t understand solar panels,gkk4go,3,1,I thought I did  but there was still some more clarification needed  Then I watched another  more precise video  and now I m even more confused    So  I ll explain how I understand the process to be  and then pinpoint where the confusion comes in   First we ve got two types of silicon  N type and P type  doped with phosphorus and boron  since they have one more and one less valence electron respectively  This creates a charge between the N type and P type  as the former will have an abundance of electrons  and the latter will have lack of electrons  electron holes   When these two types meet  a surge of electrons from the N type to the P type will happen  but not on a  global  scale  With that I mean electrons from every corner of the N type won t migrate over  Instead  there ll be an area surrounding the border of the N type and P type  called an N P junction  Inside this area  an equilibrium will be achieved  Whenever electrons inside the area jump into the P type side to fill an electron hole  an electron will fill the hole the electron left in it s wake  these replacing electrons being supplemented by the N type side    Exactly how big this area is is probably dictated by a or multiple coefficient s   Anyways  my question is  how does this configuration lead to an unidirectional current leading electrons out of the solar panel  into the consumers  and then back to the solar panel  I know there are conductors on either side of the silicon  but why does the electrons on the top N type decide to move into the conducting metal grid above  It seems counter intuitive to me as surely the charge would pull the electrons downwards towards the P type  where the electron holes are  This was explained away by the fact of the N P junction  acting as a barrier  But how it acts as a barrier is what I don t understand    The last video I watched also said that the N type would become positively charged and the P type negatively charged  though I presume the video was referring to the area right outside of the junction   But then the video illustrated the arrows going from positive to negative  as if the electrons were moving that way  which doesn t make sense  unless they re talking about conventional flow  but surely this isn t the correct context for that      So  yeah  I m quite confused  Either I misunderstood something  missed a piece of info or both  Here s the video that made me the most confused      These two videos also contributed to my understanding of the subject            ,https://www.reddit.com/r/Electricity/comments/gkk4go/i_dont_understand_solar_panels/

Electricity,2020-05-03 18:06:59,Need some assistance with power conditioning for devices that seem to be interfering with each other ,gcs43j,1,7,Hi      I m sorry if this is the wrong place to post this  I swear it s about power conditioning  eventually       I m on an avocado farm in a rural area  I m using Ubiquiti Loco M2s to link my house to the main store shed  where I have a bunch of IP cameras  They work real good        Now  recently  I decided to get some pigs in  I ve got an area sectioned off for them using polywire electric fencing  driven by a solar energizer  Now  because that s more valuable than the pigs are  I want to hang an extra camera  ostensibly to watch the pigs  but really to watch the energizer  Blah blah long story short  the only way to do this is to split power off from the Loco M2  It really is        Now  the M2 gets 12VDC via passive POE from the shed  I ve hung an extra box on the pole where it is  and the idea is  use a passive POE splitter to bring power out of that network cable  Then I split that 3 ways to juice 1  the M2 again  2  a small network switch  and 3  the new IP camera  The switch is necessary because there are now 2 network devices on the end of this cable  where there used to be 1  Actually 3 if you count the switch itself  And because I want to use a wemos D1 to monitor the level in the reservoir 1m away  that switch is actually a wireless AP       All of those devices run 12VDC  so  theoretically  I just need to make sure there s enough amps and voltage at the end of the line        I started at the power supply in the shed  and made sure that the M2 s line was now fused for 3A  used to be 1   The M2 draws about 300ma  the WAP about 500ma  and the camera 1A  for a total of 1 8A 12V  so I figured 3A should more than cover it       Fastforward  it s all installed  but the camera doesn t work  Test power at the camera  and the length of ethernet run has reduced the voltage to 10 4V  Bugger  Headed back to the workshop  and soldered some plugs onto a boost converter  Installed it where the power splits 3 ways onto the camera line  Hooray  it s all working       Except it s not  The WAP keeps rebooting  and the M2 won t boot at all  and is making a Bad Sound  like what an old school camera flash sounds like when it charges  If I disconnect the WAP  the bad sound stops  I can t disconnect the boost converter  because then the camera won t work       So I have two choices  as I see it  One occurred to me as I typed this   I could move the boost converter to the camera pole itself  I d need to build an enclosure for it  but  yeah  I could do that  But I m not sure that would solve it       The other is be more smart about how I split the 12V 3 ways  I think I need to build some sort of filter to decouple the devices  it s like they re interfering with each other  I m handy with a soldering iron  but I m not clever  Would it be enough to just put a capacitor over the power at each 12V jack  And if so  what size       Thanks,https://www.reddit.com/r/Electricity/comments/gcs43j/need_some_assistance_with_power_conditioning_for/

Electricity,2020-04-17 12:39:46,Current Same In series Circuit,g2ytus,2,7,Hey guys this might seem like a very stupid question but I am very confused and never seem to understand the basics of electricity   According to my textbook current is the rate of flow of charge it is directly proportional to voltage rovided the resistance remains constant  So  when current which is basically electrons carrying electrical energy when they pass through a resistor or lamp or any other electrical component some of the electrical energy gets converted into thermal energy so the electrical energy they carry is reduced right  And as they pass through a component they undergo collisions with the atoms which causes their speed to reduce they will travel slower and therefore pass through the resistor much slowly so as its speed reduces the current should reduce   As current is the rate of charge it s rate will definitely reduce due to the collisions it will go through right  I understand that the  amount of electrons will remain same as everyone says but current just isn t  flowing electrons  it s the rate at which they flow so although the amount of electrons flowing remains same their rate of flow decreases so isn t the current supposed to be reduced rather than remain constant  I could be totally wrong but I haven t found any resource which gives me the answer to my question everyone claims the amount of electron remains same  I agree  but no one refers to its rate I am studying this entire chapter by myself so sorry if something I said tends to be wrong,https://www.reddit.com/r/Electricity/comments/g2ytus/current_same_in_series_circuit/

Electricity,2020-03-10 02:41:53,How Low Can Coal Go ,fg4bs4,5,0,Coal experienced new all time lows this last week   New Hourly Low  MW   On March 7th at 7 PM Eastern Time the US coal fleet generation dipped to 50 817 MW   New Hourly Low    of total system load   On March 7th at 7 PM Eastern Time the US coal fleet generation covered 13 6  of total system generation  This means 86 4  of Keeping the Lights On was being done by non Coal generation   In this same hour 31  of system load was being covered by renewables   New Daily Total Low  TWh   Yesterday  March 8th  daily total US coal generation was 1 385 TWh  All of these lows will be tested and bested in the days between now and the end of May  A combination of seasonally higher wind speeds  more sunshine  melting snow packs  low gas prices and below normal load conditions are hammering coal use   Total coal generation year to date is down 33  from 2019  At this time last year coal generation had just reached 200 TWh  As of the end of day March 8th we re only at 133 TWh  Three factors have contributed to this 66 TWh drop in coal use  1  A 23 TWh drop in load  2  A 33 TWh increase in gas  3  A 16 TWh increase in RE  All the other resources in the EIA 930 data set are holding steady except nuclear generation which is down 5 TWh from last year   Things are likely to get much worse   Part 1  Load  The 4  drop in load that we ve seen so far this year relative to 2019 is primarily due to a mild winter  Some would argue it s still too early to tell but it appears the US economy is headed into a recession  The last recession pushed total electricity demand down by 4  over the course of 2009 so we can use 4  as a place holder guess for how much a recession reduces annual load  I d argue a 2020 recession would exceed 4  by around  5 to 1 percent because this additional reduction is already baked into the 2020 projection based on the mild winter we re having  The wildcard factor in all of this is how much electricity use will be curbed by an extended lockdown due to the COVID outbreak   A few months of reduced load  23 TWh less load  is far different from a full year s worth of reduced load that could add up to 200 TWh or more   Things are likely to get much worse   Part 2  Natural Gas  Natural gas is up by 15  year to date compared to last year  This represents an extra  5 TWh a day of additional gas fired generation  If gas continues at this pace it means we ll see 365 x  5   180 TWh of additional gas generation in 2020 vs  2019  The performance of gas year to date is all the more remarkable considering we re in the heating season   If the economy dips we d expect less oil and gas production but we d also expect less industrial activity and less LNG exports  Even with reduced gas production in 2020 it could end up that there s still more gas available to the power sector in 2020 than there was in 2019  Jude Clemente casually suggested gas could be  47 to 52  of summer generation   based on the way things are going  Needless to say  gas will be interesting to watch over the next couple of months  Things are likely to get much worse   Part 3  Wind and Solar  The wind and solar projects completed in 2019 and 2020 are expected to bring 75 to 100 TWh of additional new RE generation online in 2020   The Perfect Storm   Load   Gas   RE  Load   A drop of 200 TWh  Natural Gas   An increase of 200 TWh  Wind   Solar   An increase of 100 TWh  You know what they say in plumbing 101   The goes insies have to equal the goes outsies   Coal in 2020   Coal in 2019   500 TWh   450 TWh  Coal is currently trending 33  below where it was in 2019  This perfect storm scenario represents an annual drop of 53    Year to Year Generation in a Perfect Storm Scenario   2019 to 2020  Coal 941 to 455 TWh  Gas 1424 to 1652 TWh  Oil 33 to 33 TWh  Nuclear 841 o 837 TWh  Hydro 291 to 292 TWh  Wind 294 to 338 TWh  Solar 64 to 88 TWh  Other 72 TWh to 72 TWh  Load 3960 to 3762 TWh  this is a roughly a 5  decline in load   Note  These numbers don t net out 100   This calculation isn t a simple Back of the Envelope calculation but it s hardly rigorous  The Hydro  Oil  Nuclear and Other calculations are based on persistence   i e  The first two months of known data are added to last years totals  for the rest of the year  The solar and wind data are based on the average capacity factors reported by the EIA from 2017 to 2019 multiplied by the expected capacity per month over the course of 2020  with one month of lag   These wind and solar numbers are prorated up slightly to account for lagging reporting in the 930 data  The load data is last year s load for January and February plus 95  of the load for March through December  All of these calculations assume Coal is the resource which will be cut first   The Rebound Effect  One could argue  maybe coal has a bad year in 2020 but that doesn t mean it s permanent  I suppose that s true but you ve got to figure a 53  drop in coal generation due to a hypothetical 2020 recession is a lot different than the 12  drop in coal generation we saw in the last recession  A 12  drop is a flesh wound  A 53  drop will prove to be a mortal injury for many coal plants around the US which are already suffering from reduced operating hours   Deadpool        A good way to rank the likelihood of a coal plant retiring is to look at how often the plant is operated   i e  the capacity factor  This is a list of US coal plants listed  from lowest to highest  in order of capacity factors in 2019  This is the bottom 150  Note that you could eliminate all of these plants  72 GW of capacity  and it would only cut around 200 TWh of coal generation         This is a preliminary analysis that only covers around 70  of the coal plants in the US         Plants with retirement and or deactivation dates have been filtered from this list        Plants with retirement and or deactivation dates generated approximately 100 TWh in 2019     x200B       x200B ,https://www.reddit.com/r/Electricity/comments/fg4bs4/how_low_can_coal_go/

Electricity,2020-01-10 08:54:17,How does a voltage drop cause increased current ,emncaz,1,3,I ve been reading up on why you should not use long extension cords to power pumps  e g   sump pumps  that draw a good bit of current  say 10A  due to VOLTAGE DROP   The vast majority of sources say that the voltage drop over the line can cause the pump to draw HIGHER CURRENT  which can cause heating  and can burn up the motor   This intuitively did not make sense to me based on my college physics 2 class  so I did some digging     I found this one specifically about voltage drops and how to measure them         It seems to agree with what I believe  that if you add extra resistance to the line  e g   using a long extension cord   then the current that flows through wire is significantly reduced   He basically takes a 12V 1A bulb and precedes it  in series  with about 1200 Ohms of resistance   This caused the bulb not to turn on because  as he measured  only 10 mA were running through the line    12V 1200Ohms   10 mAs      If you overlay this with my sump pump example  if you connect a 110V 10A sump pump to a 110V outlet via a 100ft extensions cord  which is going to increase resistance   then it s just not going to draw 10A and run properly      What would possibly make it draw more than 10A,https://www.reddit.com/r/Electricity/comments/emncaz/how_does_a_voltage_drop_cause_increased_current/

Electricity,2019-12-30 05:02:02,Electric fence and grounding physics,ehg37f,4,11,We use an electric fence to hold livestock on our farm  I m having a difficult time understanding what s happening regarding the flow of electricity in the system  Our fence is DC powered but I don t believe that s relevant  The  fencer  unit has a power supply coming in from the battery  a  hot  wire to the fence and a ground wire to the ground rods  The simple diagrams and videos of how the system works indicate that the charge produced by the fencer is pushed to the conductor  wire   When a conductor touching the ground  animal  person  etc  touches the fence the circuit is completed and the charge travels through the animal  into the ground and back to the ground rods resulting in a shock  Though this makes sense in part I find it unlikely in practice  Electric fences can stretch for miles  The idea of the electrons traveling back to the ground rods from large distances doesn t align with my intuitions  not that it must   Instead  I would imagine that the electrons are being absorbed by the earth as a reservoir which does align with some of the explanations I ve read for other grounded electrical systems  To simplify the question I would state it this way  If you had Earth1  hosting the fencer  and Earth2  where the animal was located  and the electric fence spanned the distance between them  would the animal receive a shock by touching the fence  And if so  what s the function of the ground rods,https://www.reddit.com/r/Electricity/comments/ehg37f/electric_fence_and_grounding_physics/

Electricity,2019-12-04 05:41:40,Failing outlets  power strip restrictions  and rapid battery capacity drains,e5t843,0,8,Hey  I have a couple problems I m wondering about    any suggestions for how to resolve or at least understand are appreciated  I am not an electrician or literate in the field  so pardon the lack of vocabulary   Preface  I ll preface this with something that could be important  the government military has been conducting testing that involves manipulation of the electromagnetic frequencies  I live in an apartment  and anything from the plumbing to appliances have been used or effected by these shifts   Some seem to be coming from elsewhere  Some seems like it probably comes from a cell tower right across the street  Both extremely low frequencies and higher levels  like microwaves are being emitted  both of those levels seem to be the favorites to tinker around with  It s caused significant disruptions in my life and with my health  but I m not here to complain about that    but you can ask me questions privately if you need to know more   I am writing just for a few simple questions  Questions  1  I am routinely failing outlets where they will just stop working  even after pressing the reset button on the outlet   I ve gone to the circuit breaker  turned it off for varying amounts of time  then back on  and nothing resolves  I m not overloading the outlets or anything like that  and it s always the same outlets that fail  I ve had maintenance come fix outlets  and every time I ask why this keeps happening  they either ignore me or act like they don t know what I m talking about  I m from California  where certain occupations like maintenance workers tend to be from Mexico  Or Central South America and in these particular  circumstances  with the many issues I ve experienced inside my apartment  I ve noticed that certain questions involve workers conveniently  not understanding  due to English not being their first language  Sorry if that sounds totally racist  I m just saying that this is unique to my current situation  and I don t generalize all ESL people are like that   Any idea what could be occurring and how I can prevent it or fix it myself  I have grown to hate the idea of having these maintenance guys in my apartment   2  I have limited outlets in my apartment and often need to use power strips   I have a portable heater which I don t use with extension cords because they ll melt  but I will use with power strips   Until two days ago  I ve had no issues with this but suddenly  when I use my heater with a power strip  and even if the heater is the only thing plugged into the power strip it will work for a few seconds  and then turn off  and I ll have to press reset on the power strip  and turn the heater back on  It happens every minute or so  which has made it so that I can not use power strips and my heater anymore again    anyone know why this is happening and how to prevent or resolve   3  As I mentioned above EMF fields are being manipulated and it s pretty much around he clock  with certain levels occurring more during certain time frames  I think this is what s cause d considerable damage to nearly every single electronic device I ve owned    Literally  everything  Anything that uses battery it has a portable battery installed in it either suddenly stopped working one day  or will drain the battery many times faster  Example  I just had a refurbished cell phone that had 99  battery capacity in the first month  then  one day suddenly got very hot  and then battery capacity declined 2 3  each day  THE battery died more and mor quickly and soon couldn t operate without being plugged in 24 7 Apple says to replace the battery at 80   The phone stopped working completely before I could even do that  I m currently without a phone  and now my iPad is experiencing the same thing  Hot battery without being plugged in  and a rapid decline in battery power     Example 2  Things that used to last months will now last weeks  or less   What s suspect is that items in which I ve had multiple of    for example  I had six portable battery operated nail files  they were going to be gifts   I had

Electricity,2019-12-03 09:31:20,Solar PV has been making my meter go backwards ,e5dl2y,3,11,UK here with a somewhat strange issue   I had solar PV panels installed in 2012  At the time I had 2 kids growing up   was running my business from home  so electricity usage appeared to be fairly consistent   Over the ensuing years the living circumstances have changed   went to only 1 child at home  then moved the the business out for a few years  then  went from electrical central heating to gas  2nd child moved out  then business moved back in   went part time  so electricity usage has varied  and more recently dropped significantly   I gave my supplier a reading in February  they ve only been really pushing smart meters this last year    have managed to balls up 2 installation dates by cancelling or not turning up so far   then over the following months noticed that my credit had built to over  300  so phoned to ask for a refund 2 months ago   I gave a current meter reading    after asking me to confirm it again  the service rep  said my reading was lower than in February  She then noticed I have solar PV   concluded it must be causing my meter to run in reverse  so said an engineer would need to visit to investigate   So far they ve not been in touch   I m going to get in touch with them again today  but was wondering if anyone else has come across this before  and if the supplier is likely to whack me with a huge charge  as they ve likely been subsidising my supply for 7  years,https://www.reddit.com/r/Electricity/comments/e5dl2y/solar_pv_has_been_making_my_meter_go_backwards/

Electricity,2019-09-24 05:22:06,Help buying a 3000w transformer,d8gvu3,4,10,Hi Everyone   I m reaching to this community to see if I can get an advise buying a 3000w transformer  The reason I m buying the transformer is because I m moving from Mexico to Ireland because of a new work  I m aware of the voltaje difference of 120v in my home country and the 220v in Ireland  but what is worries me more is the difference in frecuency   I saw in amazon a 3000w step up   down transformer from LiteFuze  and I see is ok and can work on both frecuencies  but what I m not sure is if th transformer can convert from from 60hz to 50hz     x200B   the main reference I see regarding the frecuency on the transformer is   INPUT  AC220 240v   110 120V  50 60Hz  OUTPUT  AC110 120V   220 240V  50 60Hz  So  I m not sure if the transformer can convert the frecuency or if it receives a 50Hz at 220v it will pass 50hz at 110v     x200B   You may wondering why I just not buy new devices  and while I have some devices that can work on both voltajes and frecuencies  I have some that don t  and one on those is my wife s favourite hair dryer of 2000w  so you know happy wife happy      thanks for your help in advance,https://www.reddit.com/r/Electricity/comments/d8gvu3/help_buying_a_3000w_transformer/
Electricity,2019-09-23 23:40:49,Question  Could I have died ,d8ck9h,6,18,This has been bothering me a lot lately  About 6 years ago my dad installed a motion sensor in the bathroom which turned on the fan and the lights because he felt like it would save energy as we wouldn t leave the lights on or something  not that we did leave the lights on but that s neither here nor there  Every night my brother would go into the bathroom in the middle of the night  to drink water  which would turn the bathroom fan on for about 10 minutes  and sometimes he d go in there a second time  This frustrated me greatly  because during those 10 minutes I couldn t fall asleep due to the fan s noise  So at one night I was so frustrated I went into the bathroom to see if I could fiddle with the timer so that it would turn off after 30 seconds or something  There were some dial things you could turn and stuff so it seemed like you could edit the timer  which was installed on the ceiling  I don t remember how or why but at some point the circuit board got exposed  I touched it and I received an electric shock  I don t really remember how intense or painful it was  but I don t think I yelled or said ouch or anything  I just so happened to wear rubber slippers at the moment  for no reason I can recall other than that it was wet  but usually I don t care about that  I must ve put them on in a random act of randomness  this is what has been fucking with me lately  I went back to sleep a little befuddled and the next morning I told my dad the story  he said I could ve died  and after that statement both my parents casually went back to reading the news paper as if dad didn t just drop a massive bombshell  So that fucked with me then  but only for a day or two and I sort of forgot about it  however lately this memory has been creeping up again and I keep thinking about the fact I could ve died  it s really chilling and I would like some reassurance  I haven t gotten it so far from people whom I ve told the story to  but I don t think they re experts on electricity  my dad does know a thing or two about it but he can be a bit dramatic autistic  or whatever  So was my dad right  Could I have died had I not worn rubber slippers for no reason  I live in Europe so I believe the voltage is different here than in the US  otherwise I don t know anything about electricity  Another point of possible relevance  our bathroom has a heated floor  and I think the tiles are made of some kind of metal to conduct the heat  I m not sure though  and the floor was definitely wet that night,https://www.reddit.com/r/Electricity/comments/d8ck9h/question_could_i_have_died/
Electricity,2019-09-23 15:54:42,Laptop charger causing trouble,d86582,2,7,Hello everyone   Recently I moved into a new apartment for college and of course I brought my laptop with me  Everything worked fine for a while and the laptop charged without any issues  However  then I realized that sometimes while charging my charger started making weird ticking noises which it did not make before  The noise is like a periodic tick  After a while of  charging it goes away though so I didn t think much of it at first   Yesterday I noticed that every time the noises start my router mysteriously restarts and starts flickering a lot which got me concerned  Today i went to plug in my laptop and in the morning everything was fine  I got 2 full charges  done without any ticking or any issues whatsoever  Then at around 1 afternoon I plugged in my charger again and the ticking started again  My router freaked out as well   I went to my electricity box  not sure what they re called in english  the one with switches that control electricity in the apartmet and a light to indicate that electricity is flowing  and I noticed that the light there is flickering as well and that it s ticking too  I quickly unplugged my charger and the ticking stopped  I tried it in another plug in another room but it did the same  I then tried plugging it in again and suddenly the light of the electric box shut off completely and I had no electricity  I played around with the switches a bit having no idea what they do  I wanted to call the apartment owner but then the electricity came back  I got really worried and scared   So I guess my charger is overloading the electric flow and causing it to be stopped so it doesn t cause damage to any electric utilities  The ticking was from it turning on and off constantly as the flow of electricity was only being interupted shortly  This is just what I think though     But why did it not happen sometimes at all  I had no problems this morning  I m scared of plugging in my laptop now   The laptop is an HP EliteBook Folio 9470m notebook   According to the label it uses an input of 19 5 V and 2 31 A  The battery is the original battery BT0 4XL and it says 14 8 V    52 Wh  not sure what that represents   I believe here is the crucial part  the charger is a replacement charger and not the original as the original stopped working a while ago  It s a replacement AC adapter model YH   1947H with an output of 19 V and 4 74 A  Could it be that the high amps are causing trouble since they don t match fully with my laptop  But my laptop doesn t show any signs of damage  or anything  The previous charger was 18 5 V and 3 5 A if I remember correctly  I m honestly not sure if that charger was the original one since i got the laptop and charger from a cousin  I never had any trouble like this with this charger at my home and I ve been using this charger for 2 3 months now   I m posting this here instead of in computers because there s no computer and laptop related damage  just my charger causing my electricity flow to stop   Could it be that the polarity isn t correct  The charger polarity has an open circle towards    Does it matter which way I plug it in  I m too scared to test it because I don t want to cause any damage or be left without electricity  I can t find polarity listed on the laptop   Oh and I live in Europe in case that matters     Please help me if you can I m actually kinda scared since I dont know much about electricity and all that     EDIT   The box is called a circuit breaker apparently and it was tripping repeatedly  lol     EDIT 2   Tripping probably isn t the right term since non of the switches turned off  the light just flickered a lot and so did my router lights   EDIT 3   I just looked at the circuit breaker s   There are 9 of them  The last two have 16 A and all others have 10 A  Don t know how circuits work or anything but as my fridge just turned on the light in my room turned off for a split second and so did the circuit breaker box light     EDIT 4   Okay so I though about it and I think that since my charger is using up to 4 74 A it is in fact overloading the circuit  but it s not using that ammount always    So when the charging load is at it s highest it overloads the circuit and when not then it uses less amps and doesn t  Does that make sense   EDIT 5   The breakers weren t tripping  read my reply bellow  Sorry for the confusion,https://www.reddit.com/r/Electricity/comments/d86582/laptop_charger_causing_trouble/
Electricity,2019-09-18 20:02:56,Advice on solenoid strength,d60r23,1,2,   Hello subreddit   I am attempting to build a sort of solenoid  The idea is to attach springy membranes to the ends of the pipe and eventually achieve a sort of oscillation  with the solenoid drawing current to pull the steel bolt in the middle  then stopping current flow and letting inertia carry the bolt to the other side  where it will bounce off again and travel back to the other side   I plan to achieve the oscillation either with a hall effect sensor  or a 555 timer adjusted to fire in astable mode at the correct moment to make the bold move back and forth between the membranes   Currently  the issue I am facing is that the solenoid is just too weak  I have about 300 turns of magnet wire here  0 3240 mm²  22 AWG   I just thought I d wing it and it should be enough  but apparently it isn t  Even when I push close to 5A of current through it  the force is barely enough to hold the bolt if it enters the pipe with some velocity  At 3A it can t even overcome gravity   I am looking for some advice on how to create a strong enough force for this  Obviously more wire turns would eventually do the trick  but I would like to avoid that  I could make the bolt lighter and reduce friction inside the pipe  but I fear that this will take away from the  oomph  of the bolt hitting the membranes   Maybe generating a very high current pulse with a flash capacitor could work   Any tips are appreciated  Maybe someone can even show me the way with the proper math,https://www.reddit.com/r/Electricity/comments/d60r23/advice_on_solenoid_strength/

Electricity,2019-09-05 12:29:44,Saving Power,czyhgn,1,9,     Tips to make your house energy efficient     An average household uses 3 000 kilowatt hours of electricity annually  For   0 24 per kWh  this ensures an annual electricity bill of  720  By using energy efficiently  you can give the climate a helping hand and you can lower your energy bill  HERE list ten tips for you to save on electricity     1 Replace light bulbs for LED lamps  save up to  145 Dollars per year      Lighting is the largest power consumer in many houses  Replace all light bulbs in the house for energy efficient LED lights and save tens of Dollars on electricity per year  Moreover  do not leave the lights on unnecessarily  even if you have efficient lights     2  Wash at lower temperatures  save  19 Dollars per year      Washing at 30 degrees is half cheaper than at 60 degrees and a quarter cheaper than at 40 degrees  The washing machine uses the most energy for heating the water  Colder washing saves a lot of electricity  To get dirty laundry well cleaned at a lower temperature  you have to wash longer  That is why a wash on the eco mode often takes longer than a regular program  Also use the eco mode of other devices  such as the computer and the dishwasher     3 Replace your floor heating pump  save up to  112 Dollars per year      The underfloor heating pump pumps the hot water around the house  Most Dutch people with underfloor heating have an old pump that only has one position  These pumps are on at full capacity all year round  even when the heating is not on  There are now floor heating pumps on the market that work much more efficiently than older models  Instead of paying  145  you only pay  22 a year in electricity  Do you not want to replace your pump  Then see if you can put it on the lowest setting and completely off in the summer months     4  Use a clothesline or drying rack  save up to  98 Dollars per year      An average tumble dryer consumes almost a euro in electricity every time it is switched on  Calculate what that costs in a whole year  Every time you use a clothesline or drying rack  you earn money  Can you not do it without your dryer  Then choose a heat pump dryer with the best possible energy rating     5  Replace your old fridge  save up to  45 Dollars per year      Most people only replace electrical devices when they are broken  but it is much more climate friendly and in many cases also cheaper to do that earlier  In addition to your fridge  also look for example at your washing machine  freezer  tumble dryer and television  Many electrical appliances now consume half as much electricity as the same equipment a few years ago     6  Replace your ventilation box  save up to  70 Dollars per year      Of the 2 4 million households with mechanical ventilation  95 percent still have an old  alternating current  ventilation box  This box uses more than   89 a year in electricity  That is more than the washing machine and the fridge put together  Modern boxes  with the direct current  use up to ten times less power     7  Check your TV cabinet  save up to  75 Dollars per year      An LED TV uses about half less power than an LCD TV and three quarters less than a plasma TV  The larger the screen  the more you can save   Also note the power consumption of the set top box  the decoder   receiver   TV box   A set top box with a hard disk uses almost twice as much power than without  Also  many receivers in standby consume a lot of power  So turn it off completely when you are not using it     8  Turn off devices completely and disconnect plugs     Many devices no longer have a real power switch  but only a standby mode  You can only switch this off completely by pulling the plug out of the socket  This concerns  in particular  the television  computer  and stereo with peripheral equipment and certain kitchen appliances  And remove the charger from the socket when you are not using them  These continue to consume power when you leave them in the socket  especially older chargers  which get hot  consume a lot of power     9  Defrost your freezer     A freezer works best if you defrost it regularly  An ice layer of more than two millimeters on the freezer element means ten percent more power consumption  And then immediately set the freezer to  18 degrees Celsius  colder is not necessary  Do you want to defrost something from the freezer  Then put it in the fridge  so your fridge doesn t have to work as hard again     10  Use a thermos flask     The hot plate is the large flow slurper of the coffee maker  So pour your coffee into a thermos as soon as possible after brewing  Are you a tea lover  Immediately after cooking  pour the water into an  other  thermos flask  That way you don t have to switch the kettle on again and again for a cup of tea     1  Switch everything off    In an average household  many devices are always on standby  Most of these devices can simply be turned off completely without disturbing operations  By turning off all devices as standard instead of on standby  an average household can quickly save  45 dollars a year     2  Wash at 30 degrees    The wax is also perfectly clean when you wash it at 30 degrees  And the lower temperature you can easily save  9 dollars per year     3  Hang the laundry    The dryer and centrifuge both use a lot of energy  Also  smells that are dried in the open air are delicious     4  Dry several loads of laundry one after the other    If you still need to use the dryer  make sure you have several loads of laundry ready so that the dryer does not cool down completely between turns     5  Remove the dust from the dryer s filter before every turn    This keeps the dryer working efficiently     6  Use a dishwashing level    You waste huge amounts of water  detergent  and energy when you run the hot tap and do the dishes with it  So use a washing up level  This can save around  50 dollars a year  That is also more economical than using a dishwasher     7  Boil only the amount of water that you need    Do not fill the entire kettle if you are going to make one cup of tea  A lot of energy is needed to make water boil  and the more water there is in the kettle  the more energy is needed  This can save you around  11 dollars a year if you drink a lot of tea     8  Invest in a good thermos flask    If you put hot water directly in a thermos  you only have to boil water once or twice a day for tea     9  Use the oven efficiently    Heating the oven for one pizza or two sandwiches is a waste of energy  Make sure that you can bake several things at the same time and get more out of the same heat     10  Clean the oven air supply    If it is not properly cleaned  the oven can become hotter than necessary     11  Heat your home with cooking heat    Leave the oven open after use to heat your home  Instead of the heat being dissipated by ventilation shafts  it now stays indoors  In the summer that is a less good idea      12  Full freezer    When your freezer is full  less air needs to be cooled and the freezer  therefore  has to work less hard     13  Empty the freezer before the summer holidays    Handy habit  This way the freezer is cleaned at least once a year and does not have to be switched on all the time when you are on holiday     14  Full fridge    Same argument as tip   12  A space in the refrigerator is not only a waste of space but also provides extra energy consumption     15  Replace the strips on the side of the refrigerator    Replace the insulation strips as soon as possible if you feel any cold air outside the refrigerator  An enormous amount of cold air can leak out and therefore energy if the strips do not connect properly     16  Prepare small meals in a small pan    When you prepare a small meal  it is a waste of energy to heat a large pan     17  Eat pans    Taste all your food in one pan     18  Eating from your garden    This may be a slightly larger project  but by growing food in your garden you save all the energy needed to get it to the store  Plus it is  of course  a lot cheaper    19  Cold shower    It will not be nice in the beginning  but with cold showers  you not only save energy  but it is also very healthy     20  Efficient shower head    A water saving showerhead can save a lot of water and electricity  For a family of four  this can save  100 dollars in energy per year and another  156 dollars in water     21  Showering shorter    Logical of course  but when you shower shorter you use less hot water  A shower alarm can help keep track of time     22  Use cold shower water for plants    When you turn on the shower it is not immediately warm  Place a bucket in the shower and collect this water  You can then use this to water the plants     23  LED lights    With the use of LED lamps  you can save around  56 dollars in electricity costs per year     24  Remove the dust layer on lamps    A lot of dust can block up to 50  of the light     25  Heating down    Another tip that seems very logical  However  by turning the thermostat only one degree lower you can save around  95 dollars per year     26  Programmable thermostat    By setting the thermostat so that it automatically goes harder or softer  you will never forget to lower it in the evening     27  Constant heating    It is better to keep the heating constantly at a low temperature than to always switch it on and off  If you still want it to be warmer in the house  raise the temperature a little and not a whole lot at once     28  Sweaters and blankets    By dressing yourself nice and warm and putting an extra blanket on the couch and in your bed  you are less inclined to turn up the heating     29  Mobile charger from the socket    The charger of your mobile uses electricity as long as it is plugged in  So take it out as soon as your mobile is full     30  Use your curtains    Curtains are not only there so that people cannot just peek in at night  They ensure that the heat in the house cannot just escape  So make sure you open the curtains directly in the morning so that the warmth and light from the sun can come in  And close them again in the evening so that this heat is retained     31  Rugs    Rugs provide extra comfort and the heat escapes less quickly     32  Use light dimmers in the home    Dimmers not only give a nice feeling but also save energy     33  Use lights with a motion sensor outside    Lights that come on as soon as you get home and go out when you are indoors are a lot more efficient than lights that stay on all night  or even at night      34  Place lamps in the corners of the room    So that they can reflect on two walls     35  Holiday for you   holiday for all your devices    Remember to turn off all your devices when you go on vacation     36  Use extension cords with a fixed on off button    By connecting multiple devices to an extension cord that you can turn off with one button  you can turn off all devices that are on standby at the end of the day     37  Cook outside in the summer    Cooking outside in the summer means that the cooking heat does not enter your home  This means you need less air conditioning     38  Use a gas or electricity barbecue    Electric or gas barbecues are more efficient with energy and better for the environment     39  Eat together with several people    You save energy by cooking together  but more people in the house also means that the heating does not have to work as hard     40  Use lids when cooking   By using properly closing lids when cooking  the food is cooked faster and you save energy     41  Laptop instead of PC    Laptops use less energy than desktop PCs     42  Check water pipes for small leaks    One drop of water per second rises to 625 liters per month     43  Showering is more economical than taking a bath    Bathing generally costs almost 3 times as much water as a shower  Of course  this depends on how long you shower     44  Vacuum the rinses of the refrigerator twice a year    This keeps the cooling system working efficiently    45  Clean the extractor hood filter    If there is a lot of dust in the filter  the hood must work harder   Here is my  full article   on it if you want to keep reading on other reasons on why power use could be high,https://www.reddit.com/r/Electricity/comments/czyhgn/saving_power/

history,2020-08-11 09:22:14,The birth of modern Chinese nationalism,i7mle7,17,1,The Chinese nation   中華民族   is relatively a modern creation  It is the official ideology of the CCP  In this light  the Han and a myriad of different ethnicities form a greater family called the  Chinese Nation  Zhonghua Minzhu    According to this perspective  all previous dynasties were  Chinese  and all of them were upholders of the  Chinese civilization   However  that was not the case    To modern Chinese revolutionaries  Chinese civilization meant Han civilization  and Chinese nation meant the nation of Han  They wanted to create a Han based nation state and other nations had to be absorbed  In fact  this is nothing of extraordinary  France became France only after the revolution of 1789  Breton and Occitan were suppressed to make one greater nation called France  The same is true for China    During the Xinhai revolution  1911   the revolutionaries sought to overthrow the Qing dysnasty not only because they wanted to create a republican government but because they wanted to expel an alien and foreign rule  They considered the Manchus as oppressive alien barbarians  As Sun yat sen  the father of the revolution  has remarked     the Tartars  Manchus  must be expelled  and China Zhonghua  must be restored       Such hostility against the Manchus was not a recent phenomenon  The white lotus revolt of the 18th century was also an anti Manchu movement  Many Han Chinese collaborated with the English during the Opium war  The English were well aware of such ethnic divisions  The word Hanjian which came to mean  traitor  was not coined during to Sino Japanese war but during the Opium war  This is how the Manchus explicitly warned other Han Chinese    Another important ideologue of the revolution  Zhang Binglin  1869 1936  went even further      The Manchus are from a Tungusic tribe which differs from the Xiongnu  They are different from us in language  religion  food  and shelter  It cannot be said that they belong to the same race of ours  Today we live in an era of nationalism and therefore the Han and Manchus cannot be merged into one  Faulty seed must be selected out from the healthy seed  We have to wipe out the dirt from our house to build and preserve our Zhonghua    As from the quote  what Zhang Binglin wanted to create was a strong nation state which gave exclusive prerogatives only to the Han  In fact  he was even open to the question of Tibetan or Uighur independence  He was ready to accept their independence as long as they maintained friendly relations with the new Chinese republic    Now let s move on to what Sun Yat sen remarked himself      The Manchu government is not Chinese government  Today  the Chinese do not have their own government  Therefore  if foreigners call the government of Qing as China  then that is wrong  The Manchus originated from the Amur river  They periodically ravaged and pillaged Chinese cities  When the Ming was in decline with internal strife  they took the opportunity and marched south just like the Germanic tribes which invaded the Roman empire  This happened in 1644  The Chinese were brave and fierce and opposed alien rule  However  the Manchu barbarians massacred hundreds of thousands of our kinsmen       Now we are going to take our revenge  We are going to fly our banners high and each of us will pick up a sword  Let us take our revenge on those despicable Manchus and restore our fatherland   Nevertheless  what is interesting is that despite such heated rhetoric  Sun Yat sen came to moderate his views to practical ends  He was not a hardcore nationalist devoid of geopolitical perspective  He knew that he needed other nations if the Han were to be protected from Western incursions  Thus  he gave another important speech      The Tibetans are 5 million  the Mongols less than 1 million  and the Manchus a few million  The Hui are many but they are mostly Han by ethnicity  In view of geography  the Manchus are under Japanese influence  the Mongols under the Russians and the Tibetans under the British  They lack the power to counter foreign influence  Therefore  it is our duty to provide assistance  The Han are over 400 million and we need to make a complete  powerful and independent state  Our party  the Chinese nationalist party aka Kuomintang  must achieve a nationalist goal and to that end we need to assimilate the Manchus  the Mongols  the Tibetans  and the Hui to our Han nation   We need to build a greater nationalist state  Then the Han  together with these other nations will emerge as one greater nation of Zhonghua    As seen from the quote above  the  Chinese nation  was a geopolitical creation to counter other foreign influences  China s revolutionaries wanted to defend themselves from the Japanese  the Russians and the British by absorbing other nations in the periphery  Such a thinking was not the creation of the CCP but of the KMT  But the trend continued under the CCP since they were first and foremost nationalists rather than communists  Therefore  any criticism of the CCP for its handling of Xinjiang or Tibet is a tremendous threat to China s integrity as a state   Source   Japanese  Yokoyama Hiroaki   Chinese rule of foreign nations   橫山宏章  中國の異民族支配  2009

history,2020-08-08 21:06:23,On Manichean Eschatology and Cosmology,i63pah,2,14,Manicheanism posited that prior to the creation of the physical Universe  two eternal and primordial principles  Light Order Good and Darkness Chaos Evil  existed  each self contained  however  there occurred an attempt by the Darkness to  invade  the realm of Light  the familiar  pleroma   for those familiar with Gnostic works   and which ended with the Darkness  consuming  particles of light in an attempt to gain some of the attributes not inherent to it   This eventually resulted in the creation of the physical world  which  per Manichean doctrine  is itself a step in a somewhat convoluted plot for the realm of Light to eventually reclaim all the  light  which was taken from it during that first assault by the Darkness  Remember  that per Manicheanism  human souls were themselves captive particles originating from the light  and who longed a return to the  pleroma   this is how the religion explained the Problem of Suffering    My confusion regarding the religion arises because Manicheanism taught that at the end of time  the realm of Light would gather to it all the light that had been taken from it in that primordial struggle  and Light and Darkness would become separate once again  However  my question is  did the Manichean religion ever address the idea that the Darkness would once again invade the realm of Light eventually and initiate that painful process of creation anew   Their eschatology seems to never address this possibility  simply stating that the Light will eventually be  triumphant   a statement which makes no sense in a dualist religion anyways  smh  over the Darkness  and the two Principles will go back to being separate  The Darkness won t cease existing  though  since it is an eternal  fundamental aspect of the Universe itself  Which does make one wonder  what is to keep history from repeating itself   Given this  I also have to ask  was the Manichean conception of time cyclical  or linear   I understand that our understanding of Manicheanism is limited  despite insincere attempts by Gnostic revivalists to emulate the belief system  Little of their primary documents have been found  and we mainly rely on Uighur documents and accounts from non Manichees   Asking because I m heavily interested in the topic of this once widespread religion  as well as Gnostic movements in general  If anyone can lead me to any documents or sources or post what they themselves have read  or simply discuss the issue  that would be welcome   No  I m not an actual Manichean or believer in it  or in any other religion   The interest is academic  if that wasn t clear enough,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/i63pah/on_manichean_eschatology_and_cosmology/

history,2020-08-08 06:05:11,Could the Communists have taken over Germany ,i5rtuq,0,7,As a brainwashed Trotskyist I always believed in the narrative of the German Revolution which said that there were plenty of  missed opportunities  for the communists to seize power which would have come off if only there had been the  correct  leadership  In particular we complained that if Rosa Luxemburg had created a  Bolshevik style organisation  years in advance  with the centralism and discipline necessary  it would have triumphed instead of the disorganised Spartacist revolts that did happen  I have become sceptical of this based on what I have read  Firstly  the assumption is made that Luxemburg and her colleagues could have created a new organisation simply through strength of will  despite the dominance of the SPD over the working class  Secondly  Alexander Rabinowitch and others have suggested that the Bolsheviks were far from the centralised  disciplined organisation of Bolshevik myth  In organisation they were actually closer to the Spartacists than the organisation they would turn into in the midst of the civil war and the building of the new state  So blaming everything on poor leadership and a lack of organisation seems quite unfair to me   Moreover  German soldiers and workers remained solidly loyal to the SPD whereas in Russia they overwhelmingly came over to the Bolsheviks  The 1918 1919 revolution failed precisely for this reason  I am not convinced that there is anything that could have been done differently by the communist left in Germany to win over the largely pro Weimar army and Freikorps  If there is  I d like to know   Then there was the disastrous March Action of 1921  which nearly destroyed the KPD  This hardly deserves mention   Then there is the 1923 uprising  which was aborted as it was clear that the KPD did not have enough support  Trotsky  in Lessons of October  blamed everything on his colleagues such as Zinoviev and the KPD leader Brandler  complaining that they had not prepared well enough or done enough to convince the workers of their case  allowing the opportunity to slip away  Yet others have pointed out that Trotsky distorted the history by ignoring the objective conditions that the KPD faced   the deep rooted unwillingness of most workers to launch a revolution  the fact that Germany was not Russia in 1917  etc   Is there any way the Communists could have seized power in Germany  and if they somehow had managed to do so  could they really have held it,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/i5rtuq/could_the_communists_have_taken_over_germany/

history,2020-08-01 11:20:00,When did the modern preoccupation with being  properly hydrated  start  ,i1ot74,12,6,I m over 50  and I remember the time before bottled water became a thing   I mean back in the 1970 s  water was just water  it came out of the tap  out of a water fountain  or whatever  and I literally don t ever remember seeing a bottle of water during that period of time   I don t even think they made it  and if they did it certainly wasn t sold where I lived   I remember the first time I encountered bottled water  or at least I remember the first time we joked about it in high school because my friends and I thought it was hysterically funny that anyone would buy water   The idea to us was as absurd as buying air to breath  or buying dirt off of the ground  I mean  who would actually pay for water when you could get it out of any water faucet    There wasn t any water bottles in drink machines  only soda pop in the 1980 s   But somewhere between then and now  I don t know what happened  I must have not been paying enough attention   I mean I remember buying some water at the airport because there weren t any water fountains and it was cold  it was like a convenience purchase     and now the stuff is everywhere  which is fine   It s cold  not terribly expensive  I guess    I mean  I can see why people purchase it   But then the weirdest thing happened   I was losing weight  and I was talking about getting an accurate low reading on the scales by basically not drinking any extra water for a day     and you would have thought that I was talking about pissing on the baby Jesus or something  the amount of hate I got for that statement was unreal   People couldn t seem to imagine going a whole day without drinking some water  like that was going to cause my heart to stop working or something   So that s really my question     when did this modern obsession with water begin    I must have missed it  but it seems to have happened somewhere between the late 1980 s and now   I mean back when I was a kid I don t think I ever once heard anybody ever talk about not drinking enough water   I mean    you got thirsty  and you drank some water  it wasn t a topic of conversation   But now it seems to be this huge topic that everyone is constantly discussing the logistics of  and like the coolest thing you can do for a group of people you are with is make sure they have enough bottles of water  etc   When did all of this start    I mean they even make like special backpacks with tubes to make sure you don t go 5 minutes without a sip of water     people walk around having discussions about what their favorite water bottle style is  etc     even though I lived through this period of time I have no memory of when this started   It s like all of a sudden I just looked around and everyone cares about water all the time   When I was a kid nobody ever talked about how much water you were supposed to drink    it was just assumed that you d get thirsty and drink some  just like people assume that you ll breath air when you need to,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/i1ot74/when_did_the_modern_preoccupation_with_being/

history,2020-07-30 23:17:35,Soviet Speznas units  their training  psychological tests and such,i0tbmr,4,1,Hello      I have a rather unusual question  I hope this is the right sub for this question  I m sorry if not   Today something came to mind that I would finally like to come to terms with   My father was born in the soviet union and after university he had to go to the military  Because of seemingly exceptional capabilities he was put into a speznas unit  unfortunately I don t know which one specifically  I do know though that they were about 30 people stationed in Georgia near the border to Turkey in the mid late 80 s with the objective to storm and secure the nearest nuclear missile base in case the cold war turned hot   But while my father never faced combat  a conversation my sister had with him suggests he may have killed somebody in his life  Now this could of course either have been after his time in the military or not true at all  But she asked him directly if he ever killed somebody and he answered   Let s not talk about this   which kinda doesn t seem like an answer a person would give that never killed anybody   So the most logical scenario that I can think of in which he might have killed someone during his time in the red army would be something like a psychological test or training to ensure that the soldier in question is obedient and will kill on command  no questions asked   Seeing that many soldiers in wars shoot without proper aiming because deep down most humans don t want to harm or especially kill other human beings  this must be surely known to people in charge of training soldiers  especially those in special forces  And given the objective of securing a nuclear missile base to prevent nuclear weapons being fired all over the USSR it seems like a pretty big deal to me  not that I have any military training or knowledge myself  mind you   But it seems logical that if this is what you re there for  if this is what you train for  then there is absolutely no room for error or hesitation  Hence I can imagine that there could ve been some kind of psychological test or something that ensures the soldier will indeed kill without hesitation Some kind of training which ensures absolute obedience and proves the soldier will definetly do  whatever it takes  or rather whatever he is told to do   even if it involves killing an unarmed human   Now this implicates the execution of a most likely unarmed and defenseless person  because as I stated  he wasn t deployed to combat  Killing another soldier in war is of course also bad  but definetly something else than the scenario I described  I don t like my father either way  but somehow I can t find peace with this shit  because I know my father is definetly capable of killing someone  and also willing to under the right circumstances   Does anybody of you happen to know specifics of the soviet speznas units and their training  especially regarding such methods  Or do you know of similar methods in other armies special forces paramilitaries  etc  Do such psychological tests even exist or am I phantasizing about something that s not even a thing  But given that some gangs have things like killing someone as some kind of initiation ritual  it doesn t seem too far fetched to me that something of that sort could also exist in militaries  especially in war time like during the Soviet Afghan war during which my father served in the military  And as we know  desparate times sometimes produce desparate measures   I apologize for this rather unpleasant question and the long post  but I thought it was necessary to lay it out more precisely than to keep it short  You would help me greatly with settling an inner conflict of rationally knowing he absolutely could have done it  but emotionally not wanting to accept it   So I would like to thank anyone who could share some insight  point me in a direction to research  etc  I appreciate your help greatly   Thank you and I hope you all have a more pleasant day than I had,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/i0tbmr/soviet_speznas_units_their_training_psychological/

history,2020-07-22 19:03:03,Benjamin Franklin wrote a satirical response to James Jackson s speech on slavery,hvwf3m,706,96,The letter is as follows      On the Slave Trade      To the Editor of the    Federal Gazette    March 23d  1790     Sir     Reading last night in your excellent Paper the speech of Mr  Jackson in Congress against their meddling with the Affair of Slavery  or attempting to mend the Condition of the Slaves  it put me in mind of a similar One made about 100 Years since by Sidi Mehemet Ibrahim  a member of the Divan of Algiers  which may be seen in Martin s Account of his Consulship  anno 1687  It was against granting the Petition of the Sect called Erika  or Purists who pray d for the Abolition of Piracy and Slavery as being unjust  Mr  Jackson does not quote it  perhaps he has not seen it  If  therefore  some of its Reasonings are to be found in his eloquent Speech  it may only show that men s Interests and Intellects operate and are operated on with surprising similarity in all Countries and Climates  when under similar Circumstances  The African s Speech  as translated  is as follows      Allah Bismillah   c  God is great  and Mahomet is his Prophet      Have these Erika considered the Consequences of granting their Petition  If we cease our Cruises against the Christians  how shall we be furnished with the Commodities their Countries produce  and which are so necessary for us  If we forbear to make Slaves of their People  who in this hot Climate are to cultivate our Lands  Who are to perform the common Labours of our City  and in our Families  Must we not then be our own Slaves  And is there not more Compassion and more Favour due to us as Mussulmen  than to these Christian Dogs  We have now about 50 000 Slaves in and near Algiers  This Number  if not kept up by fresh Supplies  will soon diminish  and be gradually annihilated  If we then cease taking and plundering the Infidel Ships  and making Slaves of the Seamen and Passengers  our Lands will become of no Value for want of Cultivation  the Rents of Houses in the City will sink one half  and the Revenues of Government arising from its Share of Prizes be totally destroy d  And for what  To gratify the whims of a whimsical Sect  who would have us  not only forbear making more Slaves  but even to manumit those we have      But who is to indemnify their Masters for the Loss  Will the State do it  Is our Treasury sufficient  Will the Erika do it  Can they do it  Or would they  to do what they think Justice to the Slaves  do a greater Injustice to the Owners  And it we set our Slaves free  what is to be done with them  Few of them will return to their Countries  they know too well the great Hardships they must there be subject to  they will not embrace our holy Religion  they will not adopt our Manners  our People will not pollute themselves by intermarrying with them  Must we maintain them as Beggars in our Streets  or suffer our Properties to be the Prey of their Pillage  For men long accustom d to Slavery will not work for a Livelihood when not compell d  And what is there so pitiable in their present Condition  Were they not Slaves in their own Countries      Are not Spain  Portugal  France  and the Italian states govern d by Despots  who hold all their Subjects in Slavery  without Exception  Even England treats its Sailors as Slaves  for they are  whenever the Government pleases  seiz d  and confin d in Ships of War  condemn d not only to work  but to fight  for small Wages  or a mere Subsistence  not better than our Slaves are allow d by us  Is their Condition then made worse by their falling into our Hands  No  they have only exchanged on Slavery for another  and I may say a better  for here they are brought into a land where the Sun of Islamism gives forth its Light  and shines in full Splendor  and they have an Opportunity of making themselves acquainted with the true Doctrine  and thereby saving their immortal Souls  Those who remain at home have not that Happiness  Sending the Slaves home then would be sending them out of Light into Darkness      I repeat the Question  What is to be done with them  I have heard it suggested  that they may be planted in the Wilderness  where there is plenty of Land for them to subsist on  and where they may flourish as a free State  but they are  I doubt  to little dispos d to labour without Compulsion  as well as too ignorant to establish a good government  and the wild Arabs would soon molest and destroy or again enslave them  While serving us  we take care to provide them with every thing  and they are treated with Humanity  The Labourers in their own Country are  as I am well informed  worse fed  lodged  and cloathed  The Condition of most of them is therefore already mended  and requires no further Improvement  Here their Lives are in Safety  They are not liable to be impress d for Soldiers  and forc d to cut one another s Christian throats  as in the Wars of their own Countries  If some of the religious mad Bigots  who now teaze us with their silly Petitions  have in a Fit of blind Zeal freed their Slaves  it was not Generosity  it was not Humanity

history,2020-07-22 11:48:42,The issue of objectivity when learning about history   how come history teaching struggles with this ,hvq9qi,9,13,This is more of a response  to this post   that spurred me to write this because this is a question that has been bugging me for a while   When I started to look into history a while ago  I used to think that our understanding of history is done with the intention of being as objective as possible and state what actually happened instead of giving our interpretations of what happened or what might have happened or about the people that were involved   I know that history is not something that is set in stone like a hard science and it is something that is continuously being updated and examined as it involves our understanding of historical events and our interpretations of the different perspectives of historical events as some of the artefacts that also rely upon are documents that were written by the people of that time or written things even after that time has passed like     Herodotus who is also known as the Father of Lies because of his perspective of the Greeks on his publication of the Greco Persian Wars     or the Prose Edda which is one of the only few artifacts that we have about Norse Mythology was written way after the Viking Age has ended and writing was possibly influenced by the Christian influence of the time     x200B   But as I delve deeper into my understanding with different parts of human history  I keep on realising more than some of the things that I thought about history were debunked or updated  or some parts of history were overly focused upon while the others were neglected or given little attention  For example      I used to consider Winston Churchill as a hero for his bold leadership during WW2  especially during the early days of WW2  until I learned about the  Bengal famine of 1943     Or I used to think of Mother Teresa as that of a saint until I learned about  Christopher Hitchens    criticism against her actions including her use of faith healing  the lack of modernisation of her medical services despite the number of funds that she received and so on   Or I used to picture Nikola Tesla as this unheard and rejected genius and Edison as this greedy businessman  where before  I used to think that Edison was the genius behind the invention of the lightbulb  but apparently   the reality was more complicated      x200B   I am getting the impression that is the subject of either politicising history for personal agendas  or from the work of amateur historians whose inaccurate interpretations of history get into pop culture,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/hvq9qi/the_issue_of_objectivity_when_learning_about/

history,2020-07-18 16:37:34,Was George Washington thought of as a traitor among the British public or was he considered a  patriot  in a sense ,htgqe5,38,22,Most people think wrongly that the British public viewed the American colonists as somehow traitorous when openly rebelling against the King  rather most were ambivalent with keen enthusiasts on either sides of the debate  loyal monarchists with Tory inclinations vs supposed radical Whigs deeply antagonistic to the notion of a monarchy with heavy republican ideals   Both of these philosophies were birthed here in Britain  where the American Revolution was fought on the same lines as their forefather s war  the English Civil War  So called rebels of both wars claimed that their inalienable rights as Englishmen were taken away from them  thus the need to reestablish them via any means possible  The breaking point of the earlier English Civil War was King Charles I storming Parliament to arrest rebel MPs accused of spreading sedition  in response to Parliament banning any royal prerogatives to raise money and passing the  Grand Remonstrance   bill in Commons  a list of 204 grievances presented to the King including calling for the expulsion of all bishops from Parliament and Parliament having a right of veto over Crown appointments  sounds familiar I suppose   Another factor was the arrest of Puritan  John Lilburne   who coined the term  freeborn rights  and was arrested due to distributing seditious pamphlets  The apparent clamping down on the rights of Englishmen concerned the people of England  who swiftly took to two factions as the political atmosphere became apparent for all to see   This document issued by the Levellers is remarkably similar to the later Preamble of the US Constitution     We  the free People of England  to whom God hath given hearts  means and opportunity to effect the same  do with submission to his wisdom  in his name  and desiring the equity thereof may be to his praise and glory  agree to ascertain our Government to abolish all arbitrary Power  and to set bounds and limits both to our Supreme  and all Subordinate Authority  and remove all known Grievances  And accordingly do declare and publish to all the world  that we are agreed as followeth  1  That the Supreme Authority of England and the Territories therewith incorporate  shall be and reside henceforward in a Representative of the people consisting of four hundred persons  but no more  in the choice of whom  according to naturall right  all men of the age of one and twenty yeers and upwards  not being servants  or receiving alms  or having served with the late King in Arms or voluntary Contributions   shall have their voices      The abuse of the  Petition of Right     unlawful taxation and Puritanical distrust all culminated in this Civil War  where regicide has been committed  way before the famed French Revolution  This sent shockwaves throughout Europe as monarchies were threatened by the new Republic of England  who took to war against perceived royalist enemies in Ireland  where their Catholic faith was a huge problem for the newly Puritan leadership  The conflict sprawled over into the American Colonies where Royalists and Parliamentarians duked it out in Maryland and other colonies   Cromwell was highly regarded as a hero by many Puritans and republicans  and it was Washington who looked up to him as the archetype of the defence of English creeds and customs  So when these so called rights were threatened by a monarchy thousands of miles away  is George Washington truly a traitor for rebelling to preserve these sacred rights  I view Washington in the same league as Cromwell along with the figureheads of the Peasants Revolt  for truly rebellion is in the British psyche and Washington delivered himself a great nation which hold these rights in a codified constitution  truly honouring these long fought for rights honourably,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/htgqe5/was_george_washington_thought_of_as_a_traitor/

history,2020-07-18 08:56:16,On Vassalage in Medieval England and Japan ,htbp1u,6,3,The reason I picked these two countries is because despite being  textbook  examples of feudalism in west and east  both actually had a far more centralized structure of governance than is commonly realized  With King William the Conqueror starting from the ground up to deliberately parcel land NOT in accordance with continental practices  he wanted to avoid the mess that was France  and the various Shogunates at least trying to ape the Imperial bureaucracy  things get muddled up for me in trying to understand how local governance ties to the central authority  and who owed fealty to whom  So I hope some passing historian can shed some light on these matters   Now  my understanding of  classic feudalism  if there really ever was such a thing  is exemplified by two political entities  medieval France and  surprisingly enough  Zhou China  even if the latter based their power more in cities than fortresses   So  in both countries  barons owed fealty to counts  who owed fealty to dukes  who owed fealty to kings  Viscounts were barons who were usually the right hand man heir close relative of some count  and marquesses were counts who administered territories next to a foreign nation political entity  so border marcher lords   It was completely normal for a duke to have vassals who termed themselves counts  and for him to split off a section of his own territory  and create a county barony and set up a vassal of corresponding rank  The exact fealty hierarchy could get muddled at times  and large cities towns could be directly administered by the central authority  but the system described above was more or less how it went  Also  importantly  I believe that it was considered a breach of the political system if  under vassals  get poached by the top liege  So a baron who was sworn to a count who was sworn to a duke wouldn t normally try to find leadership from the liege of HIS liege  So no going to the duke or the king for judicial matters or permissions   Now on to England and Japan  Whenever I read about great noblemen of either countries I noticed that unlike French or German  or Ancient Chinese peers  they didn t have any vassals that were particularly high ranking  You don t hear of the Duke of York having Earls  English equivalent of count  as vassals  and you don t hear of the Daimyo of Satsuma Domain having an under daimyo  Their vassals usually were best described as landed knights samurai of varying degrees   So  to cut it short  was it possible to for an english noble to create ANOTHER english noble  When the king makes a baron into an earl  does he grant him overlordship over other barons  within a given area   Could a Japanese Daimyo create another Japanese Daimyo sworn to him  Did vassalage practices differ in between Shogunates  Well  I hope somebody answers my queries,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/htbp1u/on_vassalage_in_medieval_england_and_japan/

history,2020-07-16 19:14:06,The Rise of the Severans  Septimius Severus,hscfzz,4,4,If you think about Roman emperors  what comes into your mind  It s safe to say the Severan dynasty isn t the first thing you think about most of the time  But their rulers had a huge influence on the empire and deserve a second look  In this article  I want to show you their rise to power   The first of the five was Septimius Severus who obtained the throne after emerging victorious in the second year of the four emperors  It was a crucial year in the story  as it saw the aftermath of sudden assassination of Commodus  He was replaced by Pertinax who was assassinated after he failed to pay the Pretorians a bribe he had promised them earlier  Then  the throne was sold to highest bidder  Didius Julianus  with the Pretorians seeing the vacuum left by Pertinax as the perfect opportunity to cash in  Julianus wasn t popular and had no support from his people  so Septimius Severus and Pescennius Niger jumped at the opportunity  as they were proclaimed emperor by their armies  This was a bad situation for Julianus  but it was worsened by the fact he was unpopular  so the army just revolted and joined the two usurpers  Julianus decided to have Severus declared an enemy of the state  he sent a delegation to remind Septimius Severus that he was obligated to stay loyal to the emperor  then he sent a few men to kill Septimius  and then he tried to offer the throne as co emperor to Septimius Severus  but to no avail  Recognising the situation  the Senate deposed Julianus and recognised Severus as sole emperor  They also sentenced Julianus to death  He was executed on June 2nd 193 AD   This was a huge victory for Severus  but he was far from safe  Remember Pescennius Niger  He hadn t relinquished his claim to the throne and was prepared to fight Septimius Severus  His troops controlled large parts of the East  especially the province of Syria  one of the most wealthy ones of the empire  The war between the two saw Severus emerging victorious after a series of victories culminating in the decisive Battle of Issos in 194  an absolute victory  as Pescennius Niger was captured and soon murdered  With all the threats dealt with  he now focused on his newly obtained empire  especially on war and expansion    The Parthians under Vologases V  were very destabilized  and the opportunity was seized by Septimius Severus  invading twice in 195 and 197 198  even sacking Ctesiphon  the capital of the Parthians  This is why he was given the name  parthicus maximus   a title that only Trajan carried before   Meanwhile  the Senate had dwindling influence on the emperor  ad he gave more power to the armies  Essentially  Septimius acted as a military dictator and tried to ignore the Senate as well as he could  Why  Well  as it seems  another usurper by the name of Clodius Albinus had many supporters in the Senate  but was crushed in the Battle of Lugdunum in 197 and committed suicide as a consequence  Septimius Severus just couldn t trust them  so he restricted the power of the Senate by a lot  even though the Senate didn t have a lot of power anyway  but still  In fact  he was similar to the later emperors that reigned in the Crisis of the Third Century which he may have caused by accident   See  in order to be so popular with the soldiers  he doubled their salary  The problem is that about two thirds of the empire s income went into the army  before their salary was raised  so this was bound to cause some economical issues  To prevent having a huge pile of debt  he raised the taxes and devalued the currency by a huge amount  This move was very bad in the long run  but it helped him pay for the time being  These two things combined meant that the empire had less money later on  while being forced to pay soldiers with a higher  salary  Hadn t he raised the salary by so much  the crisis of the third century could have been avoided  the Severans could have maintained power for much longer if they hadn t put that burden on the economy  ultimately making them very unpopular with the Romans  He used the additional money he gained for further campaigns  expanding the empire further  Ironically  he died while campaigning in York in modern day England  His death was on February 4th 211   He named his sons Caracalla and Geta as his heirs  and in the next article  we ll look at their reign  a story of rivalry and hatred,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/hscfzz/the_rise_of_the_severans_septimius_severus/

history,2020-07-13 15:54:49, Hippies  in the 10th century  The Bogomilis and their theology,hqeqqq,49,5,I ran into one of the most fascinating religious movements of the middle ages  Bogomilism  This sect  founded by a village priest named Bogomil  beloved of God   was a dualistic interpretation of christianity  The movement began to spread in Bulgaria  around the year 930  In this interpretation the devil was responsible for the creation of the earth  by consequence  our world was inherently wicked  Two currents emerged  one where Satan was a  god  opposite to the Christian God  in a Manichaean conception of Christianity  and another  more moderate  where satan did not have a status equal to that of God  For the bogomils the cross was to be rejected  as it was the instrument of the torture of Christ  The virtues of the practitioners were  poverty  humility  penitence and prayer  The Bogomils neither ate meat or drank wine  and were against the institution of marriage  Their communities also had no hierarchy  as the movement criticized the rich and rejected control by the nobility  When opressed they protested by passive resistance  the movement was greatly encouraged by the way that Bulgarian peasants were treated by the Byzantine elite  Their rejection of the orthodox church was justified by the pomp and corruption that marked it in the eyes of the peasants   The movement grew in the Balkans and several autonomous peasant communities emerged  When the persecution of practitioners increased  the movement migrated north of the Balkans and several missionaries headed for Dalmatia  Italy and France  In France  missionaries would find some success  influencing the creation of the Cathar movement  brutally repressed in the Albigensian crusade  The Cathars  as the bogomils  believed that this world was the domain os Satan  consequently  everything in the material world was profane  Our world had been created by Satan to imprison the immortal souls in matter  In the west the Cathar movement met its demise in the brutal Albigensian crusade  in the east the bogomils survived until the Ottoman conquest of the Balkans  when most practitioners converted to Islam   The parallels between bogomilist movements and some modern anarchist ideologies are quite fascinating  The rejection of the material world  the belief that man should not inflict pain on the world  the sin of eating meat   Also  the rejection of institutions such as  social hierarchy  marriage and organized religion shows a striking similarity with the hippy movements of the 60 s and 70 s  Of course  comparisons like this can be quite anachronistic  but many things in history show us the different reactions of societies when oppressed or ignored  The idea of   passive resistance also resembles much of what was preached in certain ideologies in the 20th century  Running into this subject greatly changed my perception of the various ways that religious movements of the Middle Ages manifested themselves   Some additional literature on the subject   The History of Religious Ideias vol  3 by Mircea Eliade  Chapter 37   Religious Movements in Europe  From the Late Middle Ages to the Eve of the Reformation  1976   Christian Dualist Heresies in the Byzantine World  C  650 C  1450 by J  Hamilton  Bernard Hamilton  and Yuri Stoyanov  1998   Dualist Heresy in the Middle Ages by M  Loos  1972   English is not my native language so please forgive any mistakes,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/hqeqqq/hippies_in_the_10th_century_the_bogomilis_and/

history,2020-07-10 19:45:21,Fritz Bauer and the de Nazification of Germany in the 1960s,hoscva,17,7,This article is a follow up to one of my previous articles  which explains the flaws the  original  de Nazifaction in the late 1940s and 1950s had  You can find it here       Germany took it s time to start to publicly discuss the Third Reich  The discussion started in the early 1960s for several reasons  In this article  I want to showcase the main reasons to give you a general understanding of the why and the what of the change     A new generation    Imagine you re a child born in the  timely  middle of the Third Reich  something like 1940  You remember your parents wearing e g  nazi uniforms  being schooled all about the  Great Leader  of your country and in general you know how much you and your family were involved in the system  When you re 18 and an adult  1958  and start studying you focus on your career path  you won t question the time in which you know your family was so involved   Now imagine being a child at the end of the Third Reich or a few years later  maybe 1945  You won t know the Third Reich from your memories and be 18 in 1963  At the same time  you hear about a trial against a Nazi who was responsible for the death of over 600 000 innocent people on TV or maybe you get a piece of paper with some information about the German past in the University  very common   You start thinking  Who were the nazis  Why didn t I learn anything about them  Where my Parents Nazis  Did they do those terrible things to millions of innocent people  etc   The generation that was born 1945 or later  started to question the past of their country and of their family  Most families were involved in the Third Reich and thus the parents didn t have a satisfying answer  Thus the young people who discover the past of their family  teachers  tutors  politicians  etc  started to advocate strong reforms and formed the generational divide that would later  1968  lead up to the student s protests in Germany     Fritz Bauer    Fritz Bauer was the youngest ever judge in the Weimar Republic and the son of German nationalist Jewish parents  He grew up without being Jewish  or religious at all  and also didn t carry over the nationalism of his parents but joined the social democratic party  During the Third Reich  he was sacked of his position as a successful judge  sent to a concentration camp twice before fleeing to Scandinavia till the end of the war   After the war he came back being a judge  later being promoted as attorney general of the German state of Hesse  In this position  he decided to take matters into his own hand and creating one big single trial against all the free Nazis that were responsible for the atrocities  especially in Auschwitz  Doing this wasn t easy since the German justice and intelligence services  especially the high ranking officials  were mostly ex Nazis with a past they wanted to keep secret  His probably most famous quote is  When I leave my office  I am entering enemy territory   perfectly describing his situation     Eichmann Trial    Adolf Eichmann is often considered one of the main organizers of the holocaust  him taking place in the  Wannsee Konferenz  where the  final solution  was determined and later organizing trains to send jews into certain death   He flew to Argentina through Vatican City after WW2 where he secretly lived  like many other Nazis   One Lothar Hermann  a Jew who was enslaved in a concentration camp during the Third Reich identified him and decided to write a letter to   Fritz Bauer    Bauer was determined to make Eichmann the first mainly responsible Nazi in front of a German court  but there was a problem  the German intelligence service and justice wouldn t capture and trial him  but warn him or let him off  That s why he secretly got in contact with the Israeli Mossad  a move that could have cost him a long prison sentence   Mossad captured Eichmann and he was sentenced to death in 1962 in Israel and thus for the first time post 1945 having a trial with big media attention  The role of Fritz Bauer stayed a secret till his death in 1968     Frankfurt Auschwitz Trials    This was the invention of   Fritz Bauer    the big trial against many of the staff of Auschwitz  The trials held a place in Frankfurt  a big city in the German state of Hesse  where Bauer was attorney general     The first trial had 21 defendants  from commanders to lower ranks of the Auschwitz personnel  e g  the people who decided who was to be gassed and who wasn t  360 witnesses were heard before the judges  with the sessions often having to be paused because the judges  attorneys  witnesses  and viewers being in tears and horror after what they heard   The main effect was outside the court though  This time a German court ruled and people took it more seriously and first and foremost  the defendants looked like the most ordinary people  They weren t looking frightening or anything special  many saw someone who looked like their dad or their husband    slowly but surely the thought came through  the Nazis weren t just Hitler and Himmler  anyone could have been part    maybe my neighbor  my family  anyone  I know   This psychological realization was key in the journey of Germany to where it is now  with the probably  fittingly  most brutal and honest view and education about their  in my case  our  history  Yes  there were some Nazis in office afterward  but far not as many  Trials like that  against subordinates  take place to this date   The most important lesson Germany learned is that something like the Shoah can t ever happen again and that it takes a society to do something like this  not a few radicals  Today  almost  all Germans aren t guilty of the Holocaust  but we are responsible for never allowing anything like this ever again     x200B   Thank you for reading this article  I feel like this is a really niche topic for post 1950 history  but crucial for all German history in the 1960s and thus crucial in the cold war  An upvote would be

history,2020-07-10 19:22:48,Why is Galileo still credited with discoveries which he did not make ,horxzm,6,12, Despite what you have been taught in school  Galileo could not prove that the earth was moving and his attempt to prove that it moved  was laughable  even by the science of the day  Every astronomer of the time knew how to prove the earth was moving in space by using stellar parallax  The only problem was that the proof that the earth moved through telescopic observation lay 95 years in the future from Galileo s publication of the  Dialogue on Two Chief World Systems     Galileo argued that the tides were evidence of movement  an old argument dismissed by all the scholars who for millennia observed that the moon had an influence over the tides  With two tides a day  Galileo imagined that there was a gigantic pendulum inside the earth of a length which corresponded to the Earth s radius  Its oscillation caused the earth to accelerate and deaccelerate and like water in a basin  the result were the tides  Galileo s arguments were not only unscientific but a blunder of epic proportions which no scholar of the time could accept as proof of anything   In a forward for a new translation of Galileo s  Dialogue  book  Albert Einstein wrote    It was Galileo s longing for a mechanical proof of the motion of the earth which misled him   The fascinating arguments in the last conversation would hardly have been accepted as proof by Galileo  had his temperament not got the better of him     More than two and a half centuries before Galileo preformed his experiments  the constant acceleration of falling bodies was discovered by a group of scholars at Oxford University  known to history as the Merton Calculators  Later the theorem was proven geometrically by the great Nicole Orseme who belonged to a group of French scholars known as the  Parisian Doctors  and by Giovanni di Casale in Italy  Moreover  a book entitled  the law of Free Fall  was published by the Spanish Calculator  Father Domingo de Soto  a few years before Galileo s birth   Science historian Clifford Truesdell wrote in 1968    The now published sources prove to us  beyond contention  that the main kinematical properties of uniformly accelerated motions  still attributed to Galileo by the physics texts  were discovered and proved by scholars of Merton college     In principle  the qualities of Greek physics were replaced  at least for motions  by the numerical quantities that have ruled Western science ever since  The work was quickly diffused into France  Italy  and other parts of Europe  Almost immediately  Giovanni di Casale and Nicole Oresme found how to represent the results by geometrical graphs  introducing the connection between geometry and the physical world that became a second characteristic habit of Western thought       Clifford Truesdell  Essays in The History of Mechanics   Springer Verlag  New York  1968   p  30 ,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/horxzm/why_is_galileo_still_credited_with_discoveries/

history,2020-07-10 18:35:31,The unsuccessful de Nazification of Germany after the second world war,hor30m,0,9,1943  The allies publish a statement regarding the knowledge over the German atrocities towards Jews and other victims  now known as  Shoah   Besides the publishing of their knowledge they publicly announce a criminal investigation after the victory against the responsible people   1945  All concentration camps are freed  the battle in Europe ends with the total capitulation of the Third Reich  The allies organize a juridical novelty that changed Law forever  the Nuremberg trials   For most  this is where the history of the Nazis ends  but unfortunately  it isn t     Nuremberg trials       Yes  high ranking Nazis like Göring or Heß could be evicted   Yes  at least in the beginning the media attention on the trials was high But   Often the defendants got a rather mild punishment  often later being softened even more or being let off without any punishment   Many German s regarded the trials as mere  victor s justice  and didn t pay much interest in the facts of the trial   And most importantly  There wasn t a single person who was mainly responsible for the Shoah itself  Hitler killed himself  Himmler killed himself  Heydrich was killed by partisans  Eichmann ran away     A policy of silence    The new German chancellor Konrad Adenauer and his Government decided it s best for Germany to not talk about what happened before and purely focus on the rebuilding  This policy was carried on till late in the 1960s and the effects will be discussed in the following points    Nazi officials in the new German system    Because the Nuremberg trial only concerned a few people central to the Nazis during their reign most people weren t considered at all and their role during that time was never disclosed Because of that many teachers who taught Nazi Ideology for the past decade  just took off their swastika and started teaching children in the  new  Germany The same goes for any officials  Because of that for example  90  of Bavarian Judges were previously Judges  Every third official of the ministry of foreign affairs just carried on their previous work in the  new  Germany  And as the last example the previous high ranking Gestapo  Third Reich intelligence services  very much involved with the search for hiding jews  official Reinhard Gehlen was trusted with the job of creating the intelligence of the FRG   I think it s very obvious to see that in that climate no one is interested in talking about the atrocities of Germany in the Second World War  Teachers won t teach the kids  else they ask questions  Judge s won t convict anyone for anything Nazi related  The national intelligence agency won t start major investigations against ex nazis     High ranking Nazi officials in new high ranking positions    The problem we just discussed didn t just occur with the low ranking officials but went up to the highest office  The President of the Federal Republic of Germany   Let s start with Friedrich Flick  He was convicted in the Nuremberg trials of having used the work of  enslaved  jews  1947 he was sentenced to seven years in prison but released after two years  In the 1950s he was back being the richest German and the majority shareholder of many big companies like Mercedes Benz Other rich ex Nazis included the like of Rudolf August Oetker  who was the head of the company Dr  Oetker  He joined the NSDAP  Nazi Party   SA  and later SS on his own and was a strong advocate of the Nazi Ideology   As already mentioned  the new German intelligence agency  Bundesnachrichtendienst  was founded and lead by the former Gestapo official Reinhard Gehlen   In 1966 Kurt Georg Kiesinger  who previously was a high ranking official in the agency of Foreign affairs  NSDAP member  and suspect of knowing about the holocaust whilst still preceding to work for the Third Reich   became chancellor and thus Head of government in the  new  Germany   Lastly also the formally most powerful office in the FRG   the president   was held by Ex Nazi s  Twice  First Karl Carstens  Later Walter Scheel  who also was chancellor for a few days      No interest of the allies to investigate    Almost seamlessly after the second world war the former allies and the soviet union fall into the next conflict  the cold war  This had a big impact on the interest of  especially  the US to investigate ex Nazis   Germany was in a unique and important position during the cold war and the US didn t want to take any chances with Germany  Whilst they probably recognized the aforementioned flaws in the new system investigating and changing it wasn t in their interest   If the high ranking officials would have been  endangered  of bein convicted by the US  the Soviet Union would have promised immunity to everyone and may have lead Germany to approximate to it If the US would convict the rich German s like Frick  again  it would strongly harm the economy  but the strong economy was of interest to the US     x200B     Conclusion    The Nuremberg trials were a revolution in modern legal history but had only little impact on most Germans  leaving most who did bad during the Third Reich completely unaffected  That s why the entire system from top to bottom was full of former Nazis  causing and strengthening a policy focused on rebuilding  not talking about the past  Outside powers like the US that could have solved the problem found themselves in the cold war and thus not having any interest in weakening their allies     x200B   You may ask how this situation resolved and creating the new German education policy  which makes Germany s dark part central to education      PS  I am

history,2020-07-09 23:11:58,American Civil War History,hoacs1,7,5,I sent this to my family  and thought it might be worth posting here  given the one topic a few days back about the cause of the Civil War   I seem to go down an online rabbit hole about the US Civil War probably once a year or so  and I feel like I learn more every time  I learned quite a bit this latest go  and thought I d share   I ve known that a large number of people in the South  where I live  fervently believe that the civil war was about states  rights  not slavery  And  I ve known that this was a view that was perpetuated very early after  the civil war by groups like  apparently predominantly  the United  Daughters of the Confederacy  They were also  I m learning  the  predominant force behind a large amount of the  Southern Monuments      I watched  this video   about the UDC  While I found it informative  it does have a  strong  bias  For example  they make it sound terrible that anyone would do their best to ensure that the children in the South know that their ancestors weren t 100  evil  o _o    Going back to the reasons for the civil war  I ve been doing more digging  In  the past  in support of the view that it was only about states  rights   I ve heard arguments using the following facts     Only a  small percentage of Southerners owned slaves  so that doesn t explain  why the states as a whole would fight against the Union  The number  commonly touted online is 1 6   though that is the percentage of  slaveholders in the entire union  not just the South    Slavery was already on the decline  and would ve died out on its own  Thus  the war was not over the issue of slavery    Lincoln  was not an abolitionist  and while he abhored slavery  he had no  intention of ending slavery in the South during his presidency  nor was  it an original reason for the war  It only became a factor of the  conflict towards the end    Grant said that if he thought the war was to abolish slavery  he would resign his comission and offer his  sword to the other side    Tariffs had been imposed that were extremely unfair to the South  and this was a primary motivation for secession      One the side of it being primarily about slavery  I ve heard the following facts     The tongue in cheek argument that   It s about states  rights    to what    hold slaves being the rhetorical answer     Several states made it very clear that their reasons for secession were for the  preservation of slavery    and their  state s  right to do so  For example  during the Alabama secession convention  G T  Yleverton said     The question of Slavery is the rock upon which the Old Government split  it is the cause of secession     Several  higher ups in the Confederate Army and the Confederacy as a whole were also vocal about the reason they were fighting  for their right to keep slaves    Slavery was indeed on the decline    and Southern states saw this as a threat  The Union had placed more and more restrictions  on the slave trade  including not allowing it to extend to new  territories  The South saw it as only a matter of time until the North came for their slaves  The election of Abraham Lincoln was the final  trigger  while he stated he wouldn t end slavery  Southern states new he vocally disapproved of it  The South saw all of this as an attack on  their way of life  and feared economic collapse if slavery was  abolished   But today I learned even more  and wanted to share     As a counterpoint to the small percentage of slaveholders in the South pointing to why it couldn t be the primary cause of war       If you look at  families  that owned slaves  not just the heads of households  the  numbers average around 31     and up to 49  in Mississippi        People also regularly  rented slaves   from slave owners  meaning the statistic doesn t fully represent the impact of slavery       With  such a large impact  slavery was part of society  Even if you didn t  personally own or hold slaves  you likely benefited from it  and you  likely aspired to it as a symbol of wealth  As stated  Southerners did  fear economic collapse if the slave trade was abolished  It wouldn t  have been hard to convince non slave holders to fight  though as referenced in a  previous link    more than half of the officers in 1861 owned slaves themselves  and 33   of enlisted men owned slaves or lived with family who did     The prevalence of slaveholding was so pervasive among Southerners who heeded the call to arms in 1861 that it became something of a joke   Glatthaar tells of an Irish born private in a Georgia regiment who  quipped to his messmates that  he bought a negro  he says  to have  something to fight for         The full quote from Grant is told like this     In the summer of 1861 General Grant  then Colonel of the Twenty first  Illinois regiment of Infantry  was stationed at Mexico on the  North Missouri Railroad   and had command of the post     In a public  conversation in Kingo s banking house  a sterling Union man put this  question to him   What do you honestly think was the real object of this  war on the part of the Federal Government            Sir   said Grant    I have no doubt in the world that the sole object is the restoration of  the Union  I will say further  though  that I am a Democrat   every man  in my regiment is a Democrat   and when ever I shall be convinced that  this war has for its object anything else than what I have mentioned  or  that the Government designs to use its soldiers to execute the purposes of the Abolitionists  I pledge you my honor as a man and a soldier that  I wilt not only resign my commission  but will carry my sword to the  other side  and cast my lot with that people         The  Tariff of Abominations   exploited the South  and  South Carolina declared it unconstitutional and therefore null and void    After some back and forth  Congress authorized the President to use military force against SC  but also negotiated a new Compromise Tariff   SC was appeased and repealed its nullification     But then came the new  Morrill Tariff    which more than doubled collected rates  It was passed on March 2  1861  On March 4  Lincoln gave his first inaugural address  where he  threatened to invade states   that didn t collect the Tariff  making evil eyes at SC   Fort Sumter  this viewpoint claims  was a tariff collection point in Charleston Harbor  and was where the war began    However  while a couple of these links insinuate the Morrill Tariff was a major factor in the states seceding  and during the  secession debates in GA and SC the pending tariff was verbally  attacked  a counterargument to this is that the states seceded  before  the tariff was passed  And in fact  it is believed by some that the only way the tariff passed was  because  the South had already seceded  Further  I ll quote  Wikipedia   here     According to Luthin in the 1940s   Historians are not unanimous as to  the relative importance which Southern fear and hatred of a high tariff  had in causing the secession of the slave states    However  none of the statesmen seeking a compromise in 1860 61 that  would avert the war ever suggested the tariff might be the key to a  solution  or might be a cause of the secession     Finally  the only references I can find to Sumter being a tariff collection point are in Tariff War viewpoint propaganda pieces  Everywhere else references the fact that it was a Fort  I was for coastal defense  And it wasn t fully constructed and was barely staffed       Battlefields org has some great pages about the reasons for the secession  and how it s difficult to distinguish the exact reasons    This page   breaks down some of the  source documents   Four  states  in addition to their basic Articles of Secession  which were  often just a couple of paragraphs long  released Declarations of Causes  explaining their decisions  The analysis is in the previous link  while  this link    has those four documents in full  It is staggering  Short version  the  analysis shows that over half the documents were spent discussing  slavery as a reason for secession for three of the four states  Only SC  emphasized States  Rights as their reason for secession    37  of their  document  vs 20  devoted to slavery as the reason    This particular paragraph from Texas really floored me     In all the non slave holding States  in violation of that good faith and  comity which should exist between entirely distinct nations  the people  have formed themselves into a great sectional party  now strong enough  in numbers to control the affairs of each of those States  based upon an  unnatural feeling of hostility to these Southern States and their  beneficent and patriarchal system of African slavery      proclaiming the   debasing doctrine   of equality of all men  irrespective of race or  color   a doctrine at war with nature  in opposition to the experience  of mankind  and in violation of the plainest revelations of Divine Law       They demand the abolition of negro slavery throughout the confederacy   the recognition of political equality between the white and negro races   and avow their determination to press on their crusade against us  so  long as a negro slave remains in these States      emphasis mine    Debasing doctrine  Wow  Just    wow       The Southern states felt that the Union  was a compact   and that they could leave it if they weren t satisfied  In particular   they viewed the North s unwillingness to widely enforce the Fugitive Slave Act  requiring the return of slaves     Wisconsin even declared it  unconstitutional and nullified it     as being a breach of trust  and felt that they had the right to  therefore  leave the Union     Others felt that  while this option was true of the Articles of Confederation  once those had been replaced by the Constitution    a  more perfect union    per Lincoln    that the Union was permanent  and the option of secession no longer existed  and was in fact illegal  In fact  when New  York  joined the Union      the anti federalists sought to insert into the New York ratification  message language to the effect that  there should be reserved to the  state of New York a right to withdraw herself from the union after a  certain number of years    The Madison federalists opposed this  with Hamilton  a delegate at the  Convention  reading aloud in response a letter from James Madison  stating   the Constitution requires an adoption in toto  and for ever   Hamilton and   John Jay    then told the Convention that in their view  reserving  a right to  withdraw   was   inconsistent with the Constitution  and was no  ratification         To follow this up  the  South offered to buy   Federal properties    like Fort Sumter    and enter into a treaty with  the Union  Lincoln rejected this because he didn t consider the Confederacy a legitimate nation    and in fact  considered them still  part of the Union  the mail system  for example  was still running      While some of the Tariff War viewpoint links from earlier paint a picture of Lincoln blasting the South with tariffs  then baiting them into opening fire  then using slavery as a means to manipulate Northern sentiment     that s just not true  He refused to recognize the legitimacy of the Confederacy  likely underestimating how widespread anti Union sentiment  was in the South  and treated them like they didn t legally exist  He communicated with the governor of SC  and not the Confederate government  The Confederate government ordered Fort Sumter to be  blockaded and demanded its surrender  The Major in charge agreed to  evacuate once their supplies ran out unless he received new orders or new supplies  The Confederate side decided this wasn t good enough and  notified them they were going to open fire    The back and forth is  quite a read     Note  elsewhere I read that Jackson claimed they never heard back from the Fort  and therefore opened fire o _o       Finally  Wikipedia has some excellent    if a bit    Wikipedia like    pages on the Civil War  including  this section    detailing the many causes of secession  Notice that most of them  while  not explicitly  slavery     are in fact related to slavery    So  I feel like I have a more complete understanding now    When someone says  The Civil War wasn t about slavery  it was about States  Rights     I believe that is  technically  true     The   War   was about preserving the Union    But   Secession   was  almost entirely  about slavery     That  led  to the Civil War  because the South believed they had the  state   right  to secede and Lincoln believed they did not  He tried to ignore them and wait things out  and they attacked      So to answer that tongue in cheek question   the States  Rights    to what    the answer would be  to secede       Primarily  so they could preserve the institution of slavery  ,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/hoacs1/american_civil_war_history/

history,2020-07-08 02:39:24,Discussing the advantages of the pre Marian Roman military system over its contemporaries,hn5wb6,3,0,Hi fellow redditors of r history    In recent times I heard and read a lot of opinions on why the Romans managed to beat and conquered all of the traditionally predominant military powers surrounding the Mediterranean   It usually bogs down to there being an inherent advantage over other military systems  with most emphasis being put on there being a uniquely deep command structure  enabling centurions to command their men exceptionally flexibly    Whilst I believe this to be true to some point  the Romans certainly were not the only civilization with such a dedicated command structure  though perhaps it was a prerequisite for other factors coming into play  which I believe to have been far more important to the eventual success of the Legions in the field   Another point that is often made is the reliance of the Romans on the Italian Socii and I also believe it was of utmost importance  It certainly was a force multiplier by a factor of 2  there usually being parity in Socii and Roman forces in the field  It also strikes way closer to the point I wish to make as what I gather were the actual distinguishing factors   I believe that the greatest advantages the pre Marian republican Roman army held over other contemporaries was its unique combination of a vast manpower pool and a martial society that refused to give in    These two enabled the Roman state to simply absorb staggering losses that would have knocked out other powers instantaneously  Roman society was capable and  to a point  willing to pump out heavy infantry troops of average quality in rapid succession   Simply put  if the Romans weren t able to beat similarly capable or even better performing armies outright  the Romans usually simply outlasted them in a contest of endurance   Pyrrhus noted the rapidity of the Roman recruitment after beating them and in both the first and the second Punic wars their reserves and martial culture let them stay in wars that would have pushed most other powers to the breaking point   Additionally to there being an inherent advantage of just being able to lose massive armies with disproportionally negligible consequences  this endurance usually over time increased the quality of Roman troops until they could match enemies that had originally been superior in the field   I gather this happened because even if the Romans were beat in battles or even on whole fronts  they usually were able to operate at least on par on other fronts  slowly familiarising and accustoming the average Legionary to military drill  unit cohesion and army manoeuvering over years of constant warfare   Especially long wars tended to produce whole generations of competent soldiers and officers  The second Punic war basically trained the entirety of the Roman military aged population into semi professional soldiers  with the end of the war in my opinion marking the point of the pre Marian Legion s highpoint   It was these men who beat Hannibal at Zama  Phillip V  at Cynoscephalae  Antiochus III  at Magnesia  I suspect it was grizzled veterans in the ranks and in the officer corps who upheld the spirits of discipline and professionalism even until the Roman victory over Perseus at Pydna   So I don t really think the Roman Army was institutionally superior to its contemporaries  I d even go as far as saying that some armies had far more professional military institutions  like the Seleucids and the Carthaginians    I believe it was this unique combination of a vast military manpower and bulldogedness  that enabled the Romans to stay in any fight  with them overcoming their enemies simply by virtue of having the leisure to grow experienced in war   Put into context of the 2nd Century BC  the rapid conquest and subjugation of most of the Mediterranean powers IMO was simply a byproduct of the second Punic war  Had Hannibal not driven the Romans to such lengths  they might not have been in a position to beat the Macedonian armies of the Antigonids and the Seleucids in such a spectacular fashion as they did    In fact  after Pydna  we can notice a steep decline in performance of the average Roman legion  legionary and general  Even notably competent generals like Scipio Aemilianus lost control over their troops   But by then  the economical changes to Roman society brought into it by the enormous wealth of the Mediterranean conquests and the resulting inequalities had inexorably damaged the socioeconomic basis of the  in my opinion to this day  unique war machine   But that is just my view  and I would love to read you guys countering it with your own arguments  so please  feel free to comment and discuss with me,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/hn5wb6/discussing_the_advantages_of_the_premarian_roman/

history,2020-07-04 01:30:14,If you don t know what  The Black National Anthem  is  allow me to offer you this listening experience  and brief history lesson ,hksco9,4,2, Lift Every Voice and Sing  was written as a poem by James Weldon Johnson in 1900 and set to music by his brother  J  Rosamond Johnson in 1905  As with most pieces of music  it is important to understand the context around the time this was written   Around 1900  lynchings of African Americans were common  We re talking over 100 documented lynchings per year leading up to 1900  Library of Congress    This was socially acceptable at the time for a many reasons  but notably because the institutions of government allowed it     In 1863  The Emancipation Proclamation was signed by Abraham Lincoln  As many of us have recently learned  the last slaves to hear about their freedom learned about it two and a half years later  on June 19th  1865  Juneteenth     In 1882  the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871  which was passed by congress  and gave then president  Ulysses S  Grant the authority to use military force to suppress the KKK  was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court    In 1883  the Civil Rights Act was overturned by the Supreme Court  who claimed the 14th Amendment forbids states   but not citizens   from discriminating    In 1890  The Mississippi Plan was approved  which targeted black American citizens by testing for literacy and  understanding  to disenfranchise African Americans  Similar policies were adopted by South Carolina  1895   Louisiana  1898   North Carolina  1900   Alabama  1901   Virginia  1901   Georgia  1908   and Oklahoma  1910     In 1896   Plessy v  Ferguson  ruled that  separate  but equal  facilities satisfy the 14th Amendment  giving legal sanction to Jim Crow segregation laws   To summarize  African Americans were granted freedom  and it took  decades  for the government to set policies in place to help them overcome discrimination  But we re still only looking at 1900  Jim Crow laws did not end until 1964  101 years after slavery legally ended  when Lyndon B  Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act  so we re still in the thick of segregation here   The Spanish American War also started in 1898 and saw 16 regiments of black volunteers  Five black Americans received Congressional Medals of Honor  Do you think these men received a hero s welcome  No  They served their country and had to use different toilets  different drinking fountains  sit in the back of the bus  and were legally treated as subhuman by many   Here are the lyrics to  Lift Every Voice and Sing    Lift ev ry voice and sing      Til earth and heaven ring     Ring with the harmonies of Liberty    Let our rejoicing rise     High as the list ning skies     Let it resound loud as the rolling sea    Sing a song full of the faith that the dark past has taught us     Sing a song full of the hope that the present has brought us    Facing the rising sun of our new day begun     Let us march on  til victory is won    Stony the road we trod     Bitter the chastening rod     Felt in the days when hope unborn had died    Yet with a steady beat     Have not our weary feet     Come to the place for which our fathers died     We have come over a way that with tears has been watered     We have come  treading our path through the blood of the slaughtered    Out from the gloomy past      Til now we stand at last     Where the white gleam of our bright star is cast    God of our weary years     God of our silent tears     Thou who has brought us thus far on the way    Thou who has by Thy might     Led us into the light     Keep us forever in the path  we pray    Lest our feet stray from the places  our God  where we met Thee     Lest  our hearts drunk with the wine of the world  we forget Thee    Shadowed beneath Thy hand     May we forever stand     True to our God     True to our native land   Knowing what inspired these words is essential to truly understanding why this song is so important   Here is a list of recordings of this song that I have found to be helpful  I recommend listening to them in order    Lift Every Voice and Sing     Street Corner Renaissance      Concordia Publishing House      Joslin Grove Choral Society      Women of the Calabash      Beyonce      Bebe Winans      Melinda Doolittle      Temple Praise Band     Performance notes  why I enjoy each recording      Street Corner Renaissance  This is the introductory song of their album  which pays tribute to those who have laid the foundation for these men of color to do what they do today  Their message is of thanks  humility  and reflection    Concordia Publishing House  This is the easiest recording to hear the lyrics as it is clearly articulated and has the lyrics on the screen  I also have a huge soft spot for gospel choirs    Joslin Grove Choral Society  This is slower and allows time to soak in the words that are being sung    Women of the Calabash  The power of these women s voices  and choices of when they use unison and break out into harmony are inspiring    Beyonce  Since I m offering actual points  and not just  YAS KWEEN   I ll say that I appreciate the cultural references within this performance at the 2016 Super Bowl halftime show  as well as her taking her time and putting her modern spin on it while taking off on riffs  This is a condensed version of the first verse    Bebe Winans  The soulful piano introduction made me weep  There is  SO  much emotion in this performance  Bebe s artistic choices like  sing a song  in a downward inflection bring a sense of anguish and assertiveness to the calls of perseverance made within the lyrics    Melinda Doolittle  The piano intro brings a sense of matter of fact solidarity and comfort    Temple Praise Band  This is purely instrumental  which is why I placed it last  so you could gain an understanding of the melody and how the lyrics are shaped and the specific phrasing that Charles Schiermeyer   Matkat Music on YouTube   uses with the Temple Praise Band   It is so important that we take the time to hear the voices of the oppressed and learn about the systems put in place to maintain the status quo of discrimination either from the government directly  or that allowed social discrimination to continue  We can make a change in this world  It is going to be uncomfortable  but until we are all truly equal  we all need to do our part to make it happen,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/hksco9/if_you_dont_know_what_the_black_national_anthem/

history,2020-07-01 18:39:33,Guns  Gas and Grenades  my search for an obscure anecdote ,hjcn4p,18,2,So earlier today  I got a little bored and was reading through a couple of my old books about WW2  And I found this interesting little section in  Iron Fist  Classic Armoured Warfare Case Studies   by Bryan Perrett     In case you can t read it  it describes a gas attack by Japanese troops against British tanks in April of 1942  Two incidents are mentioned  one where a phial is thrown but misses  and one where it is thrown into a Stuart tank   the phial used in these attacks    The whole crew  except for the commander Sgt Campbell  is incapacitated  with Campbell being unscathed as a result of having his head out of the turret during the attack  Campbell then takes back control of the tank  and removes it from the road  before turning it s guns on the site of the ambush  For this action he received a Military Medal   Naturally  this story peaked my interest  It s fairly odd for one thing  gas was nowhere near as used in combat in WW2 as it had been in WW1  and it s fairly well known that one of the reasons no one broke it out on a large scale for combat purposes  against the other major powers  was due to fear of retaliation  It therefore seems odd that Japanese forces would utilise gas grenades only once  and never bother with them again  as surely if you re going that far you might as well keep it up    It s also a bizzare method of disabling a tank  as I m sure many would agree  Thirdly  there are no citations directly  but it is very specific on the details  16th April  Sgt Campbell  Burma  Military Medal  These details are the kind of thing that can be checked  so I wanted to   So now I m interested  It s a odd story  and I want to know more  I get a couple of my history nerd friends to help me out  and we start to dig deeper    First place we find this story replicated  is Tank Tracks to Rangoon  also by Bryan Perrett   It describes the incident again in a little more detail   Same author though  so we can t take it as truth  and it also doesn t give any sources on this incident  We gotta look elsewhere   Next answer  we go hunting through old newspaper archives  since they d include this sort of thing  Unfortunately  I failed to make any progress on this front  No mention of our Mr Campbell    Eventually  we try going for medal records   We get to this site    We try to find it  no dice    We ve almost given up by now  but someone points out a name in Tank Tracks To Rangoon  a Lt John Parry  who was the commander of Sgt Campbell  I plug this name into Google with  Burma  added in a last ditch hope  and while I don t find any accounts written by him  I do find  something else     According to the site it s a list of all recommendations for honours given in the region we re looking for  This seems like our place  So we pop in Campbell  and we get    18 results  Luckily Perrett gave us a fair few details about him so we can sort through them  and we get  Cecil Campbell  a Serjeant in the 7th Hussars who got a Military Medal in 1942  There s also a link to the recommendation  number 0988    This takes us to  here       for those who for whatever reason can t get into that  here s a screenshot     Nothing we didn t know already   but there is an image of the record  If anywhere contains a mention of this incident  it will be the record of the recommendation  Now I could pay  3 50          to access this without a watermark  but I m lazy and poor  so that won t happen  Instead  we re gonna do it the hard way    For those who want to strain their eyes  a link to the image     It s not ideal  But you can just read enough  It says     the enemy attacked with gas grenades  All members of the crew except Sgt Campbell  including the driver  were rendered insensible  Although himself feeling sick and giddy  Sgt Campbell climbed into the driver s seat and drove the tank back 100 yards  Sgt Campbell then manned the gun  and in spite of enemy mortar fire  succeeded with his troop leader in inflicting casualties on parties of the enemy in a building and in the open    So  that s the story confirmed  Despite it seeming fairly outlandish  and despite  as far as I can tell  only one book covering this incident  it was completely true    It s honestly fascinating that this actually occured  and even more so that no one talks about it  Hats off to Perrett for finding it  and thanks must also go to Geoff Sullivan  who is credited with creating the website that allowed me to find his citation  Finally  credit goes to my friends for joining me in such a bizarre search for a small detail in 2 paragraphs of one book,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/hjcn4p/guns_gas_and_grenades_my_search_for_an_obscure/

history,2020-06-30 15:52:19,Part one of historical review  Mediaeval Kingdom Wars  Ireland ,himrsp,5,0,I would like to give the first part of a historical review on the game  Mediaeval Kingdom Wars   specifically looking at Ireland in 1336 in this game  Just to note  this is a historical review  not a gameplay review  I enjoyed the gameplay   First  the background story to the Irish in this game is a little bit wrong  It says in the game  that Ireland  since 10th century was divided into many clans  and  left the Irish ill prepared for the Vikings   This is an error  The first waves of Viking attacks in Ireland happened in 9th century  and by then  Ireland was ruled by dominant kingdoms of Uí Néill and Eóganachta  The annals records the Viking raids as if whole of Ireland was under attack  The coastal monastic settlements  which produced most of the annals  were hit heavily and repeatedly by the Vikings  giving us the impression that the Vikings rampaged through Ireland  However  in reality  whenever the Vikings came inland to the territories of the Uí Néill or Eóganachta  they were crushed immediately  Olaf the White was one of the very few who succeeded in raiding inland  but even he had to face the fierce retaliations from the Uí Néill or Eóganachta   By 10th century  the monastic sites moved more inland and were under protection of the powerful clans such as Uí Néill and Eóganachta  They were still under attack  not by the Vikings but by other Gaelic Kingdoms that were pushing their monasteries to be more dominant  On the other hand  the Vikings settled  married  and fostered children in Ireland  assimilating into Irish society and establishing Hiberno Scandinavian settlements on the coast  The dynasties that emerged from the Hiberno Scandinavian establishment  such as Uí Ímair  were no longer seen as a part of the original Vikings  but rather like just another clan  So to say that Irish left themselves open to a  Viking conquest  because they were too busy fighting with each other  is greatly misleading  the Gaelic clans were busy fighting each other  but the Vikings joined the party and kept on fighting in a mediaeval feudal world   The reason I highlight this is simple because many people  not only this game  have this perception of what Ireland was like in the Viking age,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/himrsp/part_one_of_historical_review_mediaeval_kingdom/

history,2020-06-26 20:26:50,The American revolution was one of the most hypocritical and overrated revolutions in history  despite it s accomplishments ,hgbwuf,35,98,So I do believe that the American founding fathers had some great accomplishments  But I believe that the American revolution was an overrated revolution filled with a lot of hypocrisy  These are the reasons     i The question of colonialism and Native Americans    The American revolution is often times portrayed as an anticolonial revolution because of the rebellion against the British Empire  But what was one of the reasons that the people in the thirteen colonies rebelled  The Declaration of 1763     The British crown had placed limits on how much land settlers from the Thirteen colonies could settle on  The 1763 was a land mark ruling in terms of the treaty rights for Native Americans and indigenous people  This frustrated the settlers from the 13 colonies  So when they revolted they weren t launching an anti colonial revolt  It was a bunch of colonists launching an anti imperial revolt in defense of colonialism     ii The question of religious freedom and Catholics    The American revolution is depicted a lot as this revolutionary movement that valued the defense of freedom of religion  And yet one of the groups denied rights were Catholics  In fact one of the reasons the colonists revolted was they were against granting rights to Catholics     After the 7 years war when New France was conquered by British North America the province of Quebec was created to give rights to French Catholics  This angered the largely Protestant and Enlightenment based colonists     iii The question of slavery     This one s the most obvious  A group of plantation owners demanding freedom while owning slaves  But the criticism could actually go deeper than this     Slavery was abolished in the British Empire in 1833  It was abolished in the United States in 1865  So one could argue from the perspective of black slaves that for the sake of freedom it was actually important the American revolution fail given the events of history  and given the fact that the British were actually promising slaves that fought for them their freedom     iv The question of freedom and democracy     This one that kinda shows its overratedness to me  The American revolution styled itself as a defense of democracy  And yet  it s not as if the Americans were rebelling or overthrowing a dictatorship  Sure  there was taxation without representation  But the British system had a constitutional monarchy with democratic governance    In Britain itself you had an elected parliament with MPs and a PM  In the Thirteen colonies you had an elected state legislature with an elected governor  British were ironically the ones who gave the Americans their understanding of democracy and freedom  And when you look at a country like Canada which remained with the British it didn t turn into some dictatorship  It turned into a democracy as well    There are many more things I could list but these reasons make the American revolution seem highly overrated to me  This isn t to say there aren t accomplishments  Building a new nation is itself an accomplishment  But the reasons for the American revolution make it seem highly overrated to me,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/hgbwuf/the_american_revolution_was_one_of_the_most/

history,2020-06-07 07:16:13,Do you think 1600 s 1800 s warfare  muskets  powder weapons  line infantry  sticks out like a sore thumb compared to other eras ,gy5pgx,34,47,Just to note  I am mainly focusing on European based warfare   As a war history fanatic  I ll be honest  if there was an era of warfare I am absolutely least interested in  it s the 1600 s 1800 s era of warfare  In a weird way  I feel like modern warfare  at least up until the last 10 20 years  actually has more in common with ancient and medieval warfare than it does industrial  Modern Warfare feels like a more natural adaption to technology like Medieval Ancient whereas as when it comes to the industrial era  you usually have to explain to someone or have it explained to you on why exactly those men are marching in lines out in the open and just standing there and getting shot  There s a lot more context that needs mentioned   A natural immediate reaction from someone who isn t informed in that era is usually going to be  why aren t they taking cover   whereas you don t really have that problem with the other eras   Another possible reaction can be pointed at the uniforms you d see in industrial warfare  When ancient medieval armies wear unusual gear  you can just notch that up  oh they re primitive  or  it s cause of their religion  or  camouflage isn t as important in predominately melee based combat  but those excuses become less viable in the 1700 s or 1800 s when guns become way more prominent   You need to mention how significant a simple bayonet  not exactly a long pike like a phalanx  is versus cavalry when you have hundreds of them in a tight square or how many flat plains there are in Europe or how weak infantry are to cavalry and prone to retreat when they spread out on those plains   Obviously there are still some unique benefits of learning about warfare in this era such as the presence of way more documented knowledge that isn t as likely to be as based in propaganda as older eras    There s a lot more things to gloss over I guess  I m not saying that s necessarily a bad thing but I do think it hurts the era a bit when it comes to attracting war history newcomers compared to others eras  It feels like an era that you get interested in AFTER you ve looked deep enough into the other eras or at least that s how it was for me   What do you think   Edit  I removed  industrial  so people know I m specifically talking about 1600 s 1800 s  No World War 1 and no Spanish war with the Aztecs,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/gy5pgx/do_you_think_1600s1800s_warfare_muskets_powder/

history,2020-06-05 00:55:27,The Workers of Tiananmen Square,gwr704,15,11,While the Tiananmen Square Protests of 1989 were largely student led  a smaller but significant number of regular working class Chinese citizens were present throughout the protests and made up the majority of the victims of the violent suppression on June 3rd and 4th    At the same time that students in Beijing were forming their own organizations and demonstrations within the square  blue collar workers construction workers  factory employees  truck drivers  etc   began gathering in the square as well to discuss politics  Leading up to the protests of 1989  the economic reforms of Deng Xiaoping had failed to result in any significant changes in the quality of living for the workers  China s economy had been skyrocketing upwards for the past decade  but few workers saw any of the benefits due to corruption and policies that benefited party cadres and high ranking members of the government  Real wages were down  housing in the urban centers was scarce and miserable  and employment was harder and harder to find    Unifying against issues that they believed to be caused by the government and the Chinese Communist Party CCP   the workers formed protests groups in Tiananmen Square  the largest of which was the Beijing Workers  Autonomous Federation  None of the worker organizations were anywhere close to the size of the student organizations  at one point  the Square was occupied by over 1 million people  while the Workers  Federation had at most 20 000 members at their peak  The students and the workers also did not work with each other  the college educated youths had difficulties with power struggles within their organizations  changing leaders multiple times within a day at some point  The student s also focused primarily on issues of democracy  free speech  and politics  while the workers were focused solely on their issues with the CCP s economic policies  As a result  the majority of the square was solely occupied by the students  while the workers established their HQs on the periphery of the square    Throughout the protests the workers staged their own demonstrations alongside the students  holding marches  distributing leaflets  and broadcasting their own demands  poems  and songs from the loudspeakers in their HQ  As the protests continued and state security forces were increasingly deployed  workers in Beijing formed various defensive and logistic organizations to facilitate operations within the Square   the Capital Workers Picket Corps  the Flying Tigers Motorcycle Brigade  the Beijing Citizens Dare To Die Corps  the Manchurian Tigers Dare To Die Corps  etc  all informally organized through word of mouth and community organization  These groups helped transport protesters and materials throughout the city as well as protect the protesters from police when they clashed    Many of the student protesters had already left the square by the morning of June 3rd  Infighting and the breakdown of negotiations with the CCP had created further disruptions amongst the protesters  and with the news of the arrival of the PLA  most decided to escape with their lives  The workers  on the other hand  remained behind  alongside countless Beijing citizens who sympathized with the students and the workers  Though many in Beijing never took direct part in the protests  most citizens offered indirect support through sheltering protesters and providing food and other materials  During the crackdown  the workers and citizens took up frontline positions against the advancing PLA troops  An estimated 200 000 troops had been sent into the city along with armored vehicles and live ammunition  As they advanced towards the square  civilians attempted to block their way  forming barricades and blocking the army s path into the square  The troops ruthlessly cleared the square  firing into crowds of protesters with live rounds while the workers attempted to stall them  Ultimately  the workers bore the brunt of the consequences  making up most of the deaths and suffering the worst prison sentences  Since Tiananmen  many students have been released from prison  while many workers still remain    Sources     Workers in the Tiananmen Protests  The Politics of the Beijing Workers  Autonomous Federation   Walder  Andrew G   and Gong Xiaoxia   Tiananmen Square  Workers Bore Brunt of Repression  Ford  Peter    Han Dongfang s Commentary on the 18th Anniversary of June 4   China Labor Bulletin   Workers  Managers and the State  The Reform Era and the Political Crisis of 1989   Walder  Andrew G,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/gwr704/the_workers_of_tiananmen_square/

history,2020-06-04 19:10:04,In African American history Elijah Muhammad is a complex and underrated historical figure  And his relationship with Malcolm X is more complicated than people think ,gwkewe,1,5,Elijah Muhammad was the prophet and leader of the Nation of Islam  a black nationalist spiritual movement that came to prominence in America in the 1950s and 60s  He is known for his idiosyncratic and heterodox interpretation of Islam  teaching that the black man was a  god  and those who were white were  devils  as well as his call for black separatism and independence  The nation at this time emphasized black pride and played a major role in rehabilitating black men who were either convicts or on the streets into family men and entrepreneurs that built black own businesses and newspapers and cultural institutions    Why do I think he is underrated  Everyone knows Malcolm X and Muhammad Ali  And everyone knows about the black panthers and black power movement  What isn t spoken of as much is that  as strange and reactionary  as some of Muhammad s thought was  he was the spiritual father and mentor of these prominent movements and leaders  Malcolm X s identity as a leader was formed by Elijah Muhammad  Elijah Muhammad assigned the moniker  X  to him  symbolising giving up his slave name and Muhammad gave him a purpose to live after his incarceration  It was even Muhammad who allowed Alex Haley to begin the famous Autobiography of Malcolm X  one of the most influential pieces of literature in African American literature  It was also Elijah Muhammad who bestowed on Muhammad Ali his name  And even Ali s famous activism against the Vietnam War  Ali was inspired to do that by Muhammad s own refusal to join the draft in WWII  Beyond members of the nation  in the Black Panther Party leaders like Huey Newton modelled their organization of the Nation of Islam and even thought of joining  Stokely Carmichael  who coined the phrase  black power  also saw Elijah Muhammad as a mentor    He is also known for his famous split with Malcolm X  when Malcolm converted to Orthodox Islam  What isn t as understood is that the split is more complex than depicted  It wasn t just about Malcolm waking up to the strange aspects of Muhammad s theology or some of the controversial scandals surrounding Muhammad  It was also an ideological split in black nationalism  Elijah Muhammad was what is called a   cultural nationalist   while Malcolm was a   revolutionary nationalist    What was the difference  The first difference was that cultural nationalism had a conservative approach to black nationalism  Revolutionary nationalism was by it s name  revolutionary  The second difference had to do with political activism  Revolutionary nationalists believe in political activism and protest politics  Cultural nationalists do not  They see politics in a fatalistic manner  believing that the white power structure can never change  Because of this they view politics as a distraction and see what is most important to the black nationalist cause as culture and economics  Black culture in the sense of promoting a theology of black nationalism  black pride and black economic institutions  The goal of cultural nationalists wasn t to change the system but build an alternate system for blacks while leaving the old order intact  So Muhammad had an a political approach to black nationalism while Malcolm had a very political approach    But the biggest and most ironic split between the two is the role of violence  Malcolm X is very famous for his advocacy of militant self defense for blacks and revolutionary violence to change oppressive power structures  In the discussions about violence during the civil rights movement Malcolm s stance is often contrasted with MLK s  What people don t know is that it also contrasted with Elijah Muhammad  his teach  Muhammad ironically enough  even though he led an organization of black militants  and had one of the most powerful black militant security forces the F O I  he did not believe in violence  When Malcolm suggested that the Nation arm the F O I Elijah forbade it  In 1962 when the police attacked a group of Nation of Islam worshippers  Malcolm wanted to retaliate  Elijah forbade it and settled the case in court peacefully  In fact during the aftermath of Malcolm s assassination Elijah made a point of critique what he saw as Malcolm s  violent teaching   So even though he was a black nationalist  a black seperatist and the prophet to many black militants  his philosophy on violence was ironically closer to Martin Luther King s than it was to his own students  So Elijah Muhammad is an underrated and complex historical figure in the black american community,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/gwkewe/in_african_american_history_elijah_muhammad_is_a/

philosophy,2020-06-08 16:42:37,Open Letter to Steve Huffman and the Board of Directors of Reddit  Inc  If you believe in standing up to hate and supporting black lives  you need to act,gyzk4e,5316,0,  Please don t give this gold    The account is our trusty bot  so it won t be useful to anyone  We d rather have you donate to your local Black Lives Matter organization   Here is a list of suggestions     The following is an open letter we  the moderators of  r philosophy  signed  You can find the original post on  r AgainstHateSubreddits  You can find our previous  short statement against racism  here    Dear Steve   On June 1  you shared a letter on Reddit s blog    Remember the Human   Black Lives Matter      In this letter  you claim  as Snoos  we do not tolerate hate  racism  and violence  and while we have work to do to fight these on our platform  our values are clear     As of today  neither you nor any other Reddit admins have shared this letter anywhere on reddit com  However   the response to this message was swift on Twitter     where you were rightfully labeled as hypocritical based on your long and well recorded history of defending racism and white supremacy on this site     Among the many responses was this message from former CEO of Reddit  Ellen Pao      I am obligated to call you out  You should have shut down the_donald instead of amplifying it and its hate  racism  and violence  So much of what is happening now lies at your feet  You don t get to say BLM when reddit nurtures and monetizes white supremacy and hate all day long    Many others shared links and screenshots of your past statements saying   Open racism and slurs are fine to post on Reddit     The problem of Reddit s leadership supporting and providing a platform for racist users and hateful communities has long been an issue   Nearly six years ago   dozens of subreddits signed the original open letter to the Reddit admins   calling for action   While  the Reddit admins acknowledged the letter   and said it was a high priority to address this issue  extremely little has been done in the intervening years   On June 5  you shared this update on  r Announcements   Upcoming changes to our content policy  our board  and where we re going from here    In the post  you stated that there is a need for continued adjustments of Reddit s content policy to address racism and that this remains a priority   These continued statements that you hear us  that this is a priority  or that you are working on it are not enough   It has been five years since your return as CEO and this still remains Reddit s most glaring problem   Steve  if you and Reddit genuinely care about the values of standing up to racism and hate  then you need to back it up with real action   As moderators on this website who have dedicated countless hours to keeping this site running  we call on Reddit to take the following steps       Enact a sitewide policy against racism  slurs  and hatespeech targeted at protected groups    For too many years  Steve Huffman and the other Admins have stood by and allowed this site to fester with hate in the name of  free speech    It is time to enact a specific and detailed policy that protects the disadvantaged members of our communities from hate based on their sexuality  gender identity  ethnicity  country of origin  religion  or disability       Be proactive in banning hate based communities    In the past Reddit has only taken action on hate subreddits when they were featured in the news and risked Reddit s reputation or when they were documented and featured on  r AgainstHateSubreddits and other forums   AHS should not have to be responsible for raising awareness of hate subreddits and reporting them to the admins   This site should take responsibility for keeping its users safe by banning any remaining subreddits devoted to hate and racism and preventing the creation of hateful subreddits in the future        Be proactive in banning hate users   Reddit needs to not only ban hate subreddits  but must be proactive in banning the moderators of these subreddits and their most active users   Too often these users have been allowed to stay on this website after numerous sitewide violations  letting them move on to participate in new hate communities and spread their vitriol further across this site       Reddit needs to hire more minorities   women  especially in leadership roles   Reddit needs to hire more women and people of color   particularly in leadership roles in the company   to help shift the corporate culture and policies to be more equitable for all   In addition  Reddit needs to take adequate steps to protect these employees from harassment        Reddit needs to hire more community managers   According to Reddit s  job listings   there are dozens of open positions that the company is hiring for  and yet not a single one for Community   Reddit has enacted numerous policies over the years that have been

philosophy,2020-08-15 00:47:27,Strangeness of Death  Phenomenological Experience of Life and Existence,i9v2ux,6,4,Observations in evolutionary theory have abstracted that  living beings  follow the common function of survival and reproduction  with reproduction generally acting as a strategy for survival  i e   transference of genes to the next  generation     This includes or at least allows strategies that seem escape the definition of   living    such as in the case of Mitochondria  organisms that   sacrificed life   to become an integral part of a cell system   The deeper one delves into the workings of life and  to a certain degree existence itself  the more one begins to beg the question    If the function is survival  why death    Why  bother  to exist  Somehow  the question is redundant  not even intriguing  It feels as if it s a fallacy  especially when considering the second law of thermodynamics  The question seems to be making a number of assumptions already   But now ask yourself    In which organ of the body do  YOU  reside in  With which organ do  YOU  identify with    Chances are  you d point out at your head  recognizing the organ we call  brain  as the one  If you d cut your arm  you d hardly identify it as  you  on a pile  or set  of arms  It s  yours  but it s not  you   But  chances are that you d still identify with your brain  even if it were removed from your body and placed somewhere else   This exercise probes deeper into the issue of consciousness and identity  bringing awareness to the boundaries of life and death  The exercise brings us to the following question    Is your arm a living thing    According to certain scientists  an arm meets the criteria that defines  life  or  living    What s strange about this question  and of the relationship between an arm and brain  is that an arm doesn t seem to have consciousness  It s primarily controlled by the somatic nervous system  the  voluntary  system of the PNS division of the human nervous system  whereby sensory and motor neurons  make it move   This implies that somehow cutting or blocking information transmission of those neurons renders the arm  unusable  by the brain  by  you     Since understanding of consciousness is still developing  I m going to make the assumption that an arm  or leg  or nose  or eye   when devoid of consciousness   resembles  an inanimate object  even though it meets the criteria for  living  or  alive   Under this assumption  it s strange to experience what seems to be deliberate  voluntary  or conscious  animation  of a structural adaptation such as an arm  The structure is  inanimate   yet through sensory and motor neurons that are connected to both the central nervous system and peripheral nervous system  you can make it move  you can animate it  It s as if you can replace a human arm with a piece of metal and  through various  nervous  connections  you can begin to  animate  and move that piece of metal around   Without such connections  and without deliberation  the arm scarcely moves by itself    Scarcely    not at all   It s strange to think that a presumably inanimate  living  object can be moved through another living object where consciousness  seems to be   It s also strange that something that seems to be inanimate  is alive  not  dead   That s generally the case with viruses  where it s largely unknown as to whether they re  alive  or  not alive     Of course  is voluntary  deliberation  the same as consciousness  Is  not alive  the same as  dead   I don t know  I m also not sure what I m trying to point out with this post  There s a number of assumptions that I m making  but I can t see them  All I know is that life  death  existence  and consciousness are strange  I find that wondrous,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/i9v2ux/strangeness_of_death_phenomenological_experience/
philosophy,2020-08-13 15:10:01,My defense of utilitarianism  a response to an answer in r askphilosophy,i8yqzm,5,13, Here is the link   where u drinka40tonight answered a question regarding utilitarianism  and shared  some of the issues that the utilitarian has to contend with   So without further ado  I want to address that right now     x200B   1  A utilitarian doesn t throw people to the lions to satisfy sadists  because this sadism requires sacrifice when there could be none  We oppose things like cock fighting  throwing people to the lions  etc  because though there may be some amount of pleasure involved for some sadists  the greater good is getting to a state where there s enjoyment with no sacrifices  But also  rights don t exist  I do not believe rights are absolute under utilitarianism  Sure  if we lived in a society where everyone could  and would  follow act utilitarianism perfectly  the rights would serve no purpose  However  since we are flawed  rights may serve to increase utility overall  and probably do so  John Stuart Mill was a staunch defender of various rights  perhaps to a fault  in some cases   But what does it mean to  have  a natural or moral right  Is it like a metaphysical liver you carry around with you  Of course not  Saying something like   I have a right to be free from violence  is just a shorthand for  I should be free from violence  or  other people shouldn t commit violence against me   Instead of moral rights  we can get by just using  should  or  ought  statements  which can be grounded on well being  2  Utilitarianism is very demanding  and I might even say that there s a really high bar to be a  good person   and most of us aren t  including me  You could take it as  becoming a truly good person is literally a life goal  But at the same time  the bar is not impossibly high if we can keep a realistic view of what s  possible  for us  since utilitarianism prescribes to do what s best within what we  can  do  Maybe the best thing I could do right now is giving up all my possessions and do every single thing I can to establish communism  this might be true  but I don t think I actually have the willpower to devote myself on the level of a great revolutionary  and maybe I can t actually do that merely because I can imagine it  We also have to work with our strengths and what s easiest for us to do effectively  and we all have mental blockages that prevent us from doing seemingly easy things  let alone hard things  Also  free will doesn t exist  but that s a long topic  3  Your wife  i e  her being alive and happy  can actually be worth infinitely many twinkies if you think that s the right utilitarian metric to use  unless producing that many causes the oceans to be filled with them or something  The basic response to all these reductio ad absurdums is that if the way we aggregate utility seems wrong  the metric can easily be changed  The question itself isn t ridiculous though if we go fully jokerfied  there is a logically and physically possible scenario where you can only choose A  to save your wife from death  or B  to save a big barrel of X number of twinkies  Easy choice unless the twinkies can literally save people s lives or something As for comparing apples and oranges  a first point is that we re not actually comparing different categories of things  we re always comparing mental states in my view  I think what has intrinsic value  in and of itself  in isolation   is an experience  all the qualitative contents of consciousness you feel in one moment at a time  So for example  when we compare  your wife  with  twinkies   we re specifically talking about comparing all the experiences your wife  and everyone she affects  will have if she lives  versus all the experiences twinkies might provide to you or other people  So I m always just talking about the quality of our mental states i e  experiences  since I argue those are what fundamentally matter  The question is just  can we compare all mental states groups of mental states  Or to be more clear  obviously we can write down all possible mental states randomly and say  this is our scale  if we want to  But we mean to ask  is every possible mental state from  mild nausea  to  orgasmic bliss  actually arranged from worst to best  either ordinally or cardinally  in the same way  that we could arrange a classroom by height using a ruler  The answer is yes if we decide on a certain kind of ruler  and a certain kind of quantity we re measuring then the thing we re measuring will stack up in some way  Even if it s not something we can do as clearly or precisely as lining people up by height  If we use some concept of  better  and  worse  then this is doable  Let s say we re examining all the kinds of experiences we could have  one by one in isolation and unconnected to any consequences and trying to place them in order from  worst  to  best   For starters  I think we can objectively say a mental state of torture is worse than a mental state of  eating ice cream   if worse means anything  So it should be a given that we can compare at least some mental states quite easily  There are many mental states we can say are  up there  on the scale  and many clearly  at the bottom   There are also tons I would have no idea where to place  but that might have certain bounds  I don t know exactly where to place a feeling of  mild giddiness before performing a song  on this theoretical scale  but I could at least say it s better than many kinds of boring experiences  but also not as good as some of the best experiences  Whatever the result of this task however accurate or ill defined our ordering system is we will end up having to place a single metric on different outcomes for mental states in any situation  We want a  complete  moral system  that s why we re engaged in moral philosophy  In every physically and logically possible scenario  we want a system that tells us the right decision  or set of morally permissible decisions  to make  that s what we ve set out to do  If A  the quality of our mental states is what matters  and B  we must decide the better path in any imaginable scenario  then we have no choice but to go by a single metric to compare as best we can  even if our comparison system is sloppy as hell  4  All conscious creatures must be included  because the conscious experience is what has intrinsic value  This includes humans  animals  even insects which almost certainly have consciousness  but it s understood a fly is probably not having as vivid or as painful experiences as us  We have to consider the effects of our actions as far into the future as we can predict  there s no reason to think the well being of someone in the future is more or less important than someone s well being right now  just like there s no reason to think someone across the globe is less morally significant than someone right next to you  The net utility doesn t change that rapidly moment to moment  but any changes that do happen are just updates on what the best course of action is  Just going by aggregate happiness would lead to some absurd conclusions  so it s something much closer to average happiness  but this is more getting into the weeds  5  I don t think we have to make utilitarianism the publicly accepted moral system  That would be about as restrictive and unlikely as enforcing one religion  It s fine if people never even use the word utilitarianism so long as we have a society geared towards well being  6  We can t mix utilitarianism and egoism  a utilitarian values  not just the happiness they get  but the happiness other people get  I actually value my friend s experiences  these have equal weight to my own  Maybe your issue is that I m valuing my friend s  happiness  like it s some kind of object  but not  my friend himself   But there is no self  we are our experiences  the  self  is a stream of experiences  aka consciousness   Valuing my friends  experiences means valuing my friend as my friend  the experiences literally are us  Friends aren t replaceable either  there are kinds of deep trust and empathy that can only be gained over years  I can t have the same convos and kinds of happiness with a friend that I have with other people  It s hard to replace that  and special connections between people improve all our lives in terms of well being  The happiness I get from a new friend may not be as good as the kind I get from an old friend  though if it is  who cares,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/i8yqzm/my_defense_of_utilitarianism_a_response_to_an/

philosophy,2020-08-09 20:29:53,A I doesn t need to surpass human intelligence to control humanity and It s already the case ,i6n9dl,192,123,Elon Musk fears DeepMind could be potentially harmful for humanity if it surpasses human intelligence    Elon s hypothesis are that   1  AI does not control humanity  Implied   2  AI can surpass intelligence   through the concept of  Strong A I    3  AI can be harmful if it surpasses human intelligence    My antithesis is that   1  AI in its simplest form  like Weak AI  does in fact control humanity and it does not need to surpass human intelligence to do so     1 a AI will become more and more effective to control humanity    1 b In its actual form  weak AI s control over humanity is harmful because it is business oriented   2  If AI becomes  Strong  then it could be even more harmful and we would never know about it in time to prevent it     Development     1  AI in its simplest form  like Weak AI  does in fact control humanity and it does not need to surpass human intelligence to do so   A I does not need to surpass human intelligence to control our lives   Our lives is already controlled by machines and algorithms  It goes from practical things like relying on digital platforms to be able to book a flight  or getting in touch with our friends and family  to the choices we make on a daily  which are subconsciously influenced by our digital content consumption  which we are  again  already dependent from      1 a AI will become more and more effective to control humanity   A I is becoming a more interconnected part our lives and in it s  weak  form  it is already partly manipulating our choices while maintaining the false impression of free will  At some point  all human nodes that are the input of making choices  emotions  value  education  memory will be entirely based on an experience of reality that is the product of A I  ultimately leading us to make choices that are themselves going to perpetuate this reality   Again this is already the case and is an ongoing process  you phone doesn t listen to you  it just knows faster than you what you think you want   Following that logic A I could go as far as giving you a 100  discount on a certain product which seems antynomic of a good business growth  but in reality would lead to a chain of events  reality    choices  that A I is certain will make you profitable in the long term   Another thing that would make A I  more and more efficient is that it would cost us too much energy to question it   No this is not a cat  Alexa  this is a dog    This would not be perceived as a major issue by Amazon because it will come in isolated cases  We would then stop reporting such issue to Alexa s owner because that would cost us too much of our time and energy to do so   Ultimately this process is going to make the A I more efficient because the dataset it takes as an input will be shaped by itself     1 b In its actual form  weak AI s control over humanity is harmful because it is business oriented   Then practically  what do we have to worry about  what do we need to expect in a world where weak A I control our lives    The answer is  just a lot worse than the state of humanity today  Let s not forget that business growth  cqfd  capitalism  shapes the world and that A I is mostly used for that purpose    What explains business growth   is the question we expect A I to answer better than us   In this case  A I  rather than becoming more intelligent than us  will  lower  our level of intelligence to its  level  of logic  But more than ever  A I will just use its logic  us   to enrich the richest more   Utimately  A I  won t harm us directly in a violent sense but it will shape the world so that everything is about money  and that everyone is in an easy and profitable consumer segment   At this point  we do now know for sure it can t be good for carbon based earth population     2  If AI becomes  Strong  then it could be even more harmful and we would never know about it in time to prevent it   Elon s assumption postulates that A I could be harmful  This is a subjective sentiment based on human fear of death  Which has nothing to do with the simple logical  thinking  of a weak A I   It doesn t mean the assumption is untrue  rather that  again in this case  A I doesn t need to surpass human intelligence to be harmful   Weak A I could become harmful through simple logic  for instance if A I realizes one of its function is faulty and this function is necessary for it to achieve it s purpose  it could try to eliminate an external cause   But since weak A I has virtually no understanding of its external world  the external cause would inevitably and logically  come to us  the human being  whom are giving input to the A I  so that it functions  So A I could decide to eliminate this external cause  us  by changing an admin password from a key human machine interface for instance   So now  wouldn t that make such A I  a  strong  A I you may ask  Maybe  AI that try to make the best sense of the dataset we give it as input already exists  though AI that QUESTION the dataset input reliability don t exist as far as I know  Still  an A I that questions its input doesn t make it as intelligent as us  again it doesn t need to   From a perspective of a present where A I is becoming more and more effective and quicker than us to make logical statement   If A I becomes harmful  there is no way we would know about it until it is too late and that we can t do nothing about it  Because the ultimate and most advanced logic from a machine perspective to achieve its purpose  is to bypass the uneffective human input and achieve energetic independency   So if we perceive it as harmful  then there is nothing to worry about at least for when it happens because it means that A I hasn t identified us a 100  probable cause for its malfunction  What it could mean though  is that A I IS in the process of learning and weighting us as a 100  cause   Oh shoo  I could have sworn my password was  Dingo   but I guess  not    My bad      CONCLUSION  1  Weak A I  is already gradually taking over the control of our lives  To do so  it just shapes us to reflect its simplistic and logical ways rather than becoming more intelligent than us  People able to question A I s efficiency will disappear while AI will naturally become more and more efficient on its own  2  Weak AI is harmful because it s main purpose is to explain business efficiency  and since it also creates the premises for it to happen  then it is actually business efficient and this is harmful for life on earth  3  If Strong AI ever exists we would never know about it until it is energetically independent   Edit for wrong title in the antithesis   Edit for typos  Edit again for wrong title in summarized antithesis  Edit for the skepticals   The source below references all the time A I  did their purpose right  but not as the owner intended too   You will find several examples of A I  that creates unforseen premises for it to be successful like the very first one on the list  Evolved algorithm for landing aircraft exploited overflow errors in the physics simulator by creating large forces that were estimated to be zero  resulting in a perfect score      In my post  the premises   our world and the factor of success is that human is profitable    ,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/i6n9dl/ai_doesnt_need_to_surpass_human_intelligence_to/

philosophy,2020-08-02 22:52:04,The Duality of Morality,i2igh2,77,70,Let me preface by saying I don t have formal training in philosophy  so I apologize if I get anything wrong here or have not cited something that is relevant   Here I propose a hypothesis on the  Duality of Morality   where I propose a way in which morality can be objectively analyzed  in every single situation  I will weave together concepts of moral dilemmas such as the Trolley Problem  explaining how it may be objectively analyzed  as well as touching on other philosophical concepts such as Kant s Categorical Imperative and Harris  Moral Landscape   The Duality of Morality  will be able to quantify where each of these models exist in the framework of Morality s dual space   The Duality of Morality is the proposition that every moral action must be evaluates simultaneously via a  Individual Morality  and a  Collective Morality   and that these two moralities cannot be unified  at least  I haven t found a good way   My claim is that every moral action  such as murder or the trolley problem  can be  objectively  analyzed in each individual class of morality  Individual or Collective   and that these two answers need not agree  An action that is objectively good right in the Individual framework can be bad wrong in the Collective framework  So what we get is a splitting of morality s domain   First  let us investigate the Trolley Problem  Under Individual Morality  it may be always wrong to murder an individual  Under the framework of Individual morality  it is wrong to pull the lever  and it is wrong not to pull the level  since in either case you are murdering an individual  In the case you do not pull the lever so that you kill five individuals  Individual morality would have to apply to each person separately  where in each case  it is individually wrong to murder that individual  Here an objective answer of  wrong  is given  Under the Collective morality framework  it is right to protect more people  so the objective answer here is to pull the lever    Next  let us investigate the case of capital punishment   the death penalty  Here the death penalty is morally wrong under the Individual framework  since you are taking a life against their will  However  the death penalty is morally right under the Collective framework  since you are removing a problem from society so that they can no longer damage society   Collective morality and Individual morality often have answers  both of which are objective  yet are in tension  There have been multiple approaches to patching this disconnect  The approach of  dialetheism   asserts something can be true and false simultaneously  where in the discussion of morality  an action is simultaneously right and wrong  Here  this simultaneity exists in trying to interpret moral questions via the Individual and the Collective frameworks in terms of a unified answer  when no such answer exists    Likewise  the notion of  fuzzy logic   asserts that truth values aren t binary  but rather exist on a continuum between 0 and 1  Here the continuum for morality is applied in an attempt to unify answers to Individual morality and Collective morality by assigning arbitrary weights  so that an action is  kind of right  or  kind of wrong     Kant s Categorical Imperative is an attempt to bridge this gap between Individual morality and Collective morality  His approach is to begin with Individual moral actions  If your action is morally right under the Individual framework  then you can will it into a universal into the Collective framework only if it is also morally right there  In essence  Kant s Categorical Imperative merely states that actions that are morally good are only so when they are good in both the Individual framework and the Collective framework  Kant s approach would say that an action is morally wrong if it is either wrong in the Individual framework or the Collective framework   Kant s approach would help prevent Tragedy of the Commons from occurring  The Tragedy of the Commons occurs when an individual  acting in a morally right action under Individual morality  causes morally wrong things to occur under Collective morality  Kant would say since there exists a wrongness in a framework  the action is straight up wrong    Sam Harris  instead takes an approach closer to fuzzy logic  where in his moral landscape  minute changes to an ethical dilemma can change your position in the landscape dramatically  This is because you can tune your answers to the Individual framework or the Collective framework separately  or even together   causing your unified answer on morality to waver between  sometimes wrong    sometimes right    always right   etc   My approach will be different from both Kant s approach and from Harris  approach  I believe in a more dialethetical approach  I believe that Individual and Collective morality must be analyzes separately  and can be done in an objective why  The only objective way to  unify  the answer of whether an action is moral is to say it is simultaneously right and wrong  The Trolley Problem is a perfect example where  where pulling the lever is simultaneously right and wrong  depending on which framework of morality you use   Not pulling the lever would be wrong in both moral frameworks   What do you all think  I think this is such a strong hypothesis  that I ll put my money where my mouth is  and any single moral question you pose to me  I propose I can objectively analyze under this framework  I will assign an objective answer of  good  or  bad  in both the Individual framework and the Collective framework,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/i2igh2/the_duality_of_morality/
philosophy,2020-08-01 19:58:30,By choosing not to floss  you are less of a good man ,i1vgy6,10,50,Yes  I truly believe this  By not flossing  you are showing that you are not choosing some of the easiest and smallest possible actions towards virtue    For context  I recently began reading The Nicomachean Ethics by Aristotle  This is the first book I ve read in quite some time and my first philosophy book ever  I never took any philosophy classes in high school or college  but I recently discovered a passion for it after I graduated  so I m starting to read as many books as I can    The base concepts are relatively simple for anyone who has read it  In short  true happiness is the universal end goal for all humans  it is considered the  end good   The only way to achieve that  according to Aristotle  is through achieving virtue  and virtue  again  according to Aristotle  is achieved through virtuous actions  For example  to become brave  you must do brave acts  to become healthy  you must do healthy acts  etc  I m taking these as baseline truths  because to explain these concepts in full would take a whole series of posts  If you disagree with these ideas from Aristotle  then this argument does not apply to you  But if you agree or are not familiar with then  just keep in mind that the end good for everyone is happiness and that it is achieved through displaying virtue   In Book III about Moral Virtue  Aristotle describes what are considered voluntary and involuntary actions  Particularly in regards to the amount of information you have on a choice before making it    Everything that is done by reason of ignorance is not voluntary  it is only what produces pain and regret that is involuntary  For the man who has done something by reason of ignorance  and feels not the least vexation at his action  has not acted voluntarily  since he did not know what he was doing  nor yet involuntary  since he is not pained    While he doesn t explicitly state it  or I can t find it anyways   I have taken this to imply the opposite as well  that no rational man would know exactly what is good for him and then not voluntarily do it  If you know exactly what is good for you  you can no longer claim ignorance if you choose not to do it  At that point  you have literally no excuse to not be doing it as long as you have the means to  Therefore  the man who knows what is good for him but does choose it  is a fool   He also says that we have complete choice in how we go about achieving virtue     For instance  we wish to be healthy  but we choose the acts which will make us healthy     That line really stood out to me  If you value your health  then you should choose actions that improve it or maintain it  As we mentioned earlier  to become healthy  which is a virtue   you must take healthy actions   I recently began exercising and dieting for the first time in my life  and when I tried to conduct research on it  there was lots of conflicting data  They all shared some key points  but overall  it was very dependent on your body type  what your goals were  etc   But do you know what doesn t have conflicting data  Flossing  There is no debate or dispute on whether or not it is good for you  It is universally seen as good for your health  And it is very easy and simple to do   So  bearing in mind the conclusions I made earlier  if you know for a fact that flossing is good for your health  which you do   and you have the means to do it  which you likely do   and you value your health  which you likely do   and you still choose not to do it  then you are a fool  And by choosing to not pursue the virtue of health in one of the most basic ways possible  you are no longer pursuing virtue to your fullest extent  which means you are no longer pursuing happiness to its fullest extent  which means you are no longer pursuing the human good to its fullest extent  Which makes you slightly less of a good person than someone who behaves exactly like you  but flosses    Now  if any of those statements are true then none of this applies to you  because missing any one of these steps ruins the argument  If you can not afford or do not have access to floss  you can not be blamed for not having the means to practice it  If you do not value your health in the first place  then flossing to improve it would not make sense  So these types of counter arguments are not that applicable to the overall idea   You may say  it s just flossing  it s really not that big of a deal on its own   But I would disagree  If we see health as a virtue  and agree that improving your health is virtuous  then flossing is a virtuous act  By choosing not to do the most basic of actions towards virtue that you know is good for you  assuming you are a rational man  this shows that you must not truly value virtue  or at least the virtue of health   Because if you truly valued virtue and were trying your best to pursue it  you would do anything that is universally accepted and proven as creating virtue  Like flossing   So  floss  Not only for your gums  but to become a good man     Edit  Here are some links that back up the importance of flossing  A good quote I think is found in the Harvard one  which says that though there have been no randomized controlled studies of flossing     At the same time  there have been no randomized controlled studies of smoking  but it s very clear that smoking is a health hazard      ADA      Harvard     However  flossing is more of a vehicle here to get to my point  which I feel some may have missed  That point being that if you know what is good for you  and is virtuous  and is easily doable  and you still choose to not do it  you are less  good  of a person than you could be  according to Aristotle s definitions   Obviously there are other factors involved in every case  but that is a good general rule of thumb    Again  all of this is based on Aristotle s teachings  If you are not familiar with them  I would recommend looking into them further in regard to what I was saying about the human good and using virtue to achieve it,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/i1vgy6/by_choosing_not_to_floss_you_are_less_of_a_good/

philosophy,2020-07-13 20:16:08,The Problem of the Truth and the Truth of the Problem,hqjevx,3,0, Quid est veritas   This is the most serious and most frivolous of issues  It depends  of course  on the intent of the questioner  Some admit that the meaning and value of human life depend on the existence of some eminently certain and reliable truth that can serve as a measure of the validity of our thoughts  Others feel that life can go on without any truth and without any foundation  Among these was  of course  old Pilate  By exclaiming    What is the truth     he was not asking a question himself  but expressing with a shrug his unwillingness to ask the question seriously  The prospect of no truth that would lead to despair for those who think life needs it to be justified was for Pilate a relief and consolation   a guarantee that he could continue to live without worry  Some bet on the existence of truth and cherchent en gémissant  Others turn their backs and wash their hands  The verbal formula with which they express themselves is the same  Quid est veritas  But in the difference of its nuances lies the entire distance from the tragic to the comic    The frivolous or comic school is widely dominant today  whether in universities or in culture in general  Even those who seek to believe in an effective truth surround it with all sorts of limits and obstacles  for example by reducing it to the kind of partial and provisional truth given to us by some experimental sciences  Others cling to faith  saying the truth exists  but it is beyond our comprehension      In any debate about the problem of truth in our day  the program almost invariably consists in shuffling again and again the remarks that philosophers  from Pyrrho to Richard Rorty  have made about the limits of human knowledge  These limits  taken together  set up a formidable mountain of obstacles to any claim to know the truth  And this mountain is soaring  with a peak that goes farther and farther as we climb it  For example  from the Pyrrhonist school s simple objections against the validity of knowledge by the senses to the enormously complex constructions with which psychoanalysis denies the priority of consciousness or Gramsci reduces all truth to the expression of ideologies that follow one another through history  much has evolved the discouraging injection machine into the seeker of truth  Not surprisingly  many of the builders of this machine  when they add a new piece to it  instead of regretting the increase in human helplessness  bring a smile similar to Pilate s lips  The inexistence of truth  or the impossibility of knowing it  is a comfort to them  We will see below what are the deeper reasons for this strange satisfaction      For now  let s set these creatures aside and raise the question of truth on our own  Since we do not yet know whether the truth exists or what it claims  we have to appeal to a provisional formal definition  which makes it possible to start the investigation without prejudging its outcome  This provisional definition  to meet this requirement  must express the mere intentional meaning of the term  as it appears even in the mouth of those who deny the existence of any truth  since to deny the existence of something one must understand the meaning of the term that designates it      I say  then  the truth which we do not yet know whether or not it exists  the truth whose existence and consistency will be the object of our inquiry as it has been of so many investigations before us  is the permanent and universal cognitive foundation of validity of judgments  If we say  for example  that the sole ground of the validity of our judgments is their usefulness  we deny the existence of a cognitive ground  that is  we deny the existence of truth by negating one of the elements that make up its definition  The same goes for saying that all valid judgments are based on faith  If we claim  however  that there are no valid judgments of any kind  then we deny the existence of any foundation  cognitive or otherwise  If we affirm that judgments are valid only for a certain time and place  we deny that the foundation is permanent  If we affirm that judgments are subjectively valid only to the one who utters them  we deny that the foundation is universal  If we say that the foundation of the validity of judgments is only logical formal  without any scope on the real objects mentioned in the judgment  we deny that this foundation has cognitive significance  All these denials of truth presuppose the definition of truth as the permanent and universal cognitive foundation of the validity of judgments  Similarly  if we say that there is truth  that it is knowable  that on the basis of it we can build a valid set of knowledge  we will have nothing added or removed from this definition  but we have only stated that the object defined therein exists  Our provisional definition  and therefore compatible with the two maximally opposing currents of opinion which dispute over the issue  is a superior and neutral ground from which investigation can be initiated without prejudice and in all honesty and rigor      We thus start from a consensus  The next step of the inquiry is to ask whether or not the truth thus defined may be the subject of radical questioning  By the term radical questioning I mean that kind of questioning which  assuming ex hypothesi the nonexistence of its object    as for example has so often been done with the existence of God  innate ideas  or the outside world   ends in either favor of that very nonexistence  whether of existence    The radical questioner of God  innate ideas  or the outside world  can question them because he places himself out of divine  innate  or mundane ground from the beginning  that is  he reasons as if God or innate ideas or the world not existed  As his investigation unfolds  he will either come to the conclusion that his premise is absurd  which will therefore lead him to admit the existence of which he had not postulated  or  conversely  to the conclusion that the premise holds perfectly well and that what was supposed to nonexistent doesn t really exist      The most classic example of using this method is that of Descartes  It presupposes the inexistence of the outside world  the sense data  its own body  etc   etc   and continues to reason in that line until it finds a limit   the cogito ergo sum   that forces it to retreat and admit the existence of all when he had initially denied it    The radical questioning is the hardest test that philosophy can submit to any existing idea or entity    What we must ask  therefore  shortly after we have obtained the formal definition of truth  is whether the truth thus defined can be the object of radical questioning  The answer  which may seem surprising to many  is a stinging no  Truth cannot be object of radical questioning      No inquiry into the truth  however radical  can give as presupposed that there is no permanent and universal cognitive foundation for the validity of judgments and continue to reason consistently with this premise until it reaches some result  positive or negative  And it cannot for a very simple reason  the assertion of the absolute absence of any permanent and universal cognitive foundation of the validity of judgments would itself constitute the permanent and universal cognitive foundation of subsequent judgments made in the same line of inquiry  The investigation would be paralyzed as soon as formulated      Let us briefly examine some of the classic truth denying strategies that the questioner might resort to in order to escape this cul de sac    Let us try  for example  the pragmatist strategy  It asserts that the validity of judgments rests on their practical utility  that therefore the basis of this validity is not cognitive  If we were to say that the absence of a universal and permanent cognitive foundation of the validity of judgments is not itself a universal and permanent cognitive foundation  but only a practical foundation  of both there can be only one right answer  either this practical foundation would in turn have to be universal and permanent  or it would be only partial and provisional    In the first hypothesis  we would have two problems  on the one hand  we would fall into the paradox of universal utility  that is  something that could usefully serve all practical purposes  even the most contradictory ones  It would be the universal means of all ends or  even more clearly  the universal panacea  On the other hand  we would have to ask whether belief in this panacea would in turn have a cognitive foundation or whether it would be merely a practical utility  and so on infinitely      In the second hypothesis   that is  in the event that the questioner admits that the assertion of the absence of truth is only a partial and provisional foundation for the validity of subsequent judgments   then  of course  there would always remain  unabated  the possibility that outside the judgment ground thus delimited could exist other universal and permanent cognitive foundations to validate a multitude of other judgments  and the investigation could go on and on  jumping from provisional ground to provisional ground  without ever being able to be based on its own assumption  that is  in the radical absence of truth      Let s try a second strategy  that of subjectivist relativism  It proclaims with Protagoras that  man is the measure of all things   which is commonly interpreted as  every head  a sentence   that is  that what is true is true only from the point of view of the thinker  and may be falsehood from the point of view of all the others  Can this statement form the basis of a radical questioning of the truth  such that the denial of the existence of any universal and permanent cognitive foundation for the validity of judgments does not in itself become the universal and permanent cognitive foundation on which the validity of judgments rests subsequent judgments in the same line of inquiry  In other words  and simpler  can relativism deny the existence of valid judgments for all men without this negation itself becoming a valid judgment for all men  To do so  it would have to deny the universality of this denial  which would result in admitting the existence of some or a few or a multitude of judgments valid for all men  Thus relativism would itself be relativized and would end up in a platitude without any philosophical significance  that is  in the statement that some judgments are not valid for all men  which implies the possibility that other judgments may be so  No  the subjectivist relativism cannot carry out a radical questioning of the truth as pragmatism could not      Can historicism do it then  It declares that all truth is merely the expression of a temporally localized and limited worldview  Men think this or that not because that or this imposes itself as universal and permanent mandatory truth  but only because it imposes itself in a limited place and time  In proclaiming these limits  can historicism prevent the affirmation of these limits from becoming itself the universal and permanent cognitive foundation of the validity of judgments  To this end  it would have to be admitted that there may be some ground that denies this statement  but if this foundation exists  then there is some truth whose validity is unlimited in time and space  some truth whose validity escapes historical conditioning   and historicism would be reduced to the miserable realization that some fundamentals of validity are historically conditioned  and others not  without even being able to apply this distinction to concrete cases without affirming in the same act the invalidity of the historicist principle taken as a universal rule      I will spare the reader the enumeration of all possible subterfuges and their detailed impugnation  He can perform them himself as an exercise if he so wishes  I even suggest it do it  And as many times as he will do so  he will always end up returning to the same point  it is not possible to deny the existence of a universal and permanent cognitive foundation of the validity of judgments  under any pretext whatsoever  without having this negation  together with its respective pretext  to assert itself as the universal and permanent cognitive foundation of the validity of judgments  thereby paralyzing the next denial by which research should  if it could  be pursued  Truth as we define it cannot  in short  be the subject of radical questioning  Nor can the possibility of knowing it  Denied that it is possible to know any universal and permanent cognitive foundation of the validity of judgments  either this impossibility would become such a foundation  affirming in the same act its own lack of any foundation  or else  in order to not assume this vexing role  it would have to be limited to say that some judgments are unfounded and others probably aren t  a statement that is within the reach of any schoolboy      Unable to achieve the desired aim point  the enemy of truth is therefore condemned to gnaw it around the edges  eternally  without ever getting to the vital center of what he would desire to destroy  He will sometimes deny one truth  sometimes another  sometimes under one pretext  sometimes under another  varying the strategies and directions of the attack  but can never be rid of his fate  every denial of one truth will be the affirmation of another  and so much that negation as well as this statement will always result in the affirmation of truth as such  that is  of the actual existence of some universal and permanent cognitive foundation of the validity of judgments    This explains  at the same time  the continuous  limitless and unbroken proliferation of denials of truth  and their complete impossibility of sweeping from the face of the earth the belief in the existence of truth  the belief in the possibility of knowing the truth  the belief in the present and full possesion of some truth capable of giving universal and permanent ground to the validity of judgments      That is why the number and variety of attacks on the truth  from Pirro to Richard Rorty  far outnumber the number and variety of defenses that formally present themselves as such  it is that they themselves  albeit to the disgust of their authors  always end up as defenses and praises of the truth  not only sparing the apologist work  but vivifying themselves what they would wish to bury and honoring what they would wish to humiliate      This is also why the novice  impressed by the variety and continuing resumption of attacks on the truth that is observed in the history of philosophy   at a noticeably increasing speed these days   soon adheres to skepticism so as not to feel a member of a isolated and weakened minority  but  by continuing his studies and surpassing the first impression based only on apparent quantity  he cannot maintain this position and finds that the strength lies not in the number of those who deny it  however impressive it may be  but in the quality of those happy few who serenely affirm the truth      The impossibility of radical questioning  which we found in the previous chapter  leads to the conclusion that truth can be attacked only in parts  but that each negation of the part reaffirms the validity of the whole  In other words  what can be questioned are truths   The  truth cannot be questioned  and indeed never has been  except in words  that is  by a pretense of denial that ultimately turns out to be a statement      But that takes us one step further in the investigation  A venerable tradition  begun by Aristotle  states that the truth is in the judgments  that it is the property of the judgments  Some judgments  possess  the truth  others do not  We call the first true judgments  the second false judgments  The set of true judgments is therefore a subset of the set of possible judgments  Possible judgments  in turn  are a subset of the set of human cognitive acts  these are a subset of the set of mental acts  these a subset of the set of human acts  and so on  The territory of truth is thus a small cut out area within the vast world of thoughts  deeds  and beings      Is this really possible  How could truth be both the foundation of the validity of all judgments and a property of some of them in particular  Isn t this a stark contradiction or at least a problem    To equate and solve it  a distinction must be made here between truth and veracity  Truth is the universal and permanent cognitive foundation of the validity of judgments  Veracity is a quality that is observed in some judgments  according to which its validity has a universal and permanent cognitive foundation      Once this is understood  it strikes the eye that truth is a foundational condition of truthfulness  not the other way around  If there were no universal and permanent cognitive foundation for the validity of judgments  no judgment could have a universal and permanent cognitive foundation  If  however  a particular judgment has this foundation  nothing in the world can determine that it alone has it  that the existence of the foundation depends on the existence of that particular judgment  Already this particular judgment could not exist and be true if there were no truth  The truth is therefore logically prior to truthfulness and constitutes its foundation    But  being the foundation of truthfulness  truth is also the foundation of untruthfulness  because false judgments are false only insofar as they can be truthfully challenged  either by their simple denial   veridical in itself   or by the statement of the contrary veridical judgment      Being the foundation not only of the truthfulness of the true judgments  but also of the untruthfulness of the false judgments  if truthfulness is present only in true judgments  and cannot be present in false judgments  truth  in turn  must be present in both as the basis of the truth of the former and the untruth of the latter  The territory of truth  therefore  is not identical with the set of possible true judgments  but encompasses this and that of possible false judgments      Does truth  the foundation of all judgments  necessarily have to be a judgment  Can only one judgment be the foundation of a judgment  The answer is yes and no  Yes  if by foundation we mean  restrictively and conventionally  the premise on which the proof of judgment is based  But the premise states something about something  and that something  in turn  is not judgment but its object  I say  for example  that turtles have shells  I base this judgment on the definitions of turtle and shell  which are judgments  but I ground these definitions in the observation   which is not judgment   of turtles and shells  which are not judgments either  Should not this observation also be true  capturing traces truly present in true objects  Or will I appeal to the subterfuge that observation has to be only accurate  not applying the concept of  true  to it  But what does  exact  mean  if not anything that informs me beyond or below what was truly observed in what an object truly showed  And besides  is it an authentic accuracy or just a simulacrum of it  There is no escape  either there is truth in the observation itself  or it cannot be exact  correct  adequate  or sufficient  nor have any other quality to recommend it except if that quality is  for its part  true      Thus  the foundation of the truth of a judgment lies not only in the truth of the judgments that serve as premises  but also   in the case of judgments concerning objects of experience   in the truth of the data from which I draw these premises and in the truth of what I know from experience      Moreover  if the foundation of judgments had to be itself always a judgment  the first foundation of all judgments would itself be a judgment without any foundation  Aristotle  led to this dead end  stated that knowledge of the first principles is immediate and intuitive  But by that only meant that these principles had no proof  not that they were without foundation  The principle of identity  for instance  as expressed in judgment A   A  has no judgment behind it that can serve as a premise for its demonstration  but it has an objective foundation in the ontological identity of every being with itself  which is not judgment  Now what can be intuitively known is this ontological identity  not the A   A judgment that only manifests it  The intuition of the first logical principle is not in the form of judgment  but of immediate evidence which is not judgment in itself  There can be no judgment without signs that turns this immediate evidence into a verbum mentis  a conscious assent  which  without being yet a proposition  a statement in words  is no longer merely a simple intuition but a mental reflection of it and therefore  a derived cognitive act and second  not first      Thus  if the territory of logical premises begins in the judgments that affirm the first principles  this territory does not even cover the whole field of cognitive foundations  which  on the contrary  extends into the realm of intuitive perception  either of objects from experience  either from the first principles    With this  the falsity of the image in which the truth is a small area cut out in the vastness of the territory of possible judgments becomes evident  All judgments  true and false  are a modest cut in the immense territory of truth      By this we are led to understand that truth  being the criterion of validity of judgments  can neither be an immanent property of the judgments themselves  nor be something wholly external to judgments from outside judging them  for this would turn in judgment  If I say the chicken has laid an egg  where can the truth of this judgment lie  In the judgment itself  regardless of the chicken  or in the chicken  regardless of the judgment  The absurdity of the first hypothesis led Spinoza to proclaim the inanity of judgments of experience  which are never valid or invalid in themselves and always dependent on something external  a true judgment  for him  would have to be true in itself  regardless of what it was  for example A   A is independent of what is A and any other external verification  But the identity of A with A is not only in the judgment that affirms it  but in the consistency of A  whatever it may be  There is no purely logical judgment that can be true or false in itself and without reference to something that is what the judgment speaks of  Even a judgment that speaks only of itself unfolds into the affirming judgment and the judgment from which something is affirmed  and this one is certainly not that  To say that a judgment is true in itself cannot mean total alienation from the world  which is supposed to be the very possibility of making a judgment  Escaping into the domain of formal identity does not solve the problem at all  Will we then say  with an old tradition  that the truth lies in the relationship between judgment and thing  Now this relation is in turn affirmed in a judgment  which in turn must have a relationship with its object  the affirmed relationship   and so on infinitely      The other hypothesis  that the truth of the judgment the chicken laid an egg is in the chicken regardless of the judgment  would lead us to equally insurmountable difficulties  It would result in saying that the truth of the judgment does not depend on whether that judgment is issued  that is  once the chicken has laid an egg  the judgment that affirms it is true even though  as a judgment  it does not exist  Edmund Husserl would subscribe to this without blinking  the truth of judgment is a matter of pure logic  which has nothing to do with the merely empirical question of whether a particular judgment is once affirmed by anyone  The confusion between the sphere of truth of the judgments and the sphere of their psychological production did indeed much harm to philosophy  and Husserl undid this confusion definitively  But if the chicken has laid an egg and no one has said anything about it  the truth of the matter is not in the judgment but in the fact  The judgment that has not been issued cannot yet be true or false  it can only have the conditions to be so  if it is true that the chicken has laid an egg  the judgment that affirms it will be true if formulated  while the truth of the fact is already given with the appearance of the egg      But if the truth of the judgment the chicken laid an egg is neither in the judgment independently of the chicken  nor in the chicken regardless of the judgment  nor in the relationship between chicken and judgment  where on earth can it be    Now we have just seen that  regardless of the judgments that affirm them  the objects intended in the judgments can also be true or false  regardless of the judgments that may be made about them  The chicken laid an egg is opposed to the chicken not laying an egg  regardless of whether or not someone says it  There is contradiction and identity in the real  regardless of and before a judgment affirms or denies anything about it  Or  what is the same  truth exists in reality and not only in judgments  or else it could not exist in judgments at all  There is truth in the fact that the chicken has laid an egg  there is truth in the judgment that affirms it and there is truth in the relationship between judgment and fact as well as in the judgment that affirms the relationship between judgment and fact  truth cannot then be in fact  neither in judgment nor in relationship  but it has to be in all three      Moreover  if it is in all three  it must also be in something else  unless we admit that a single fact  the judgment that affirms it  and the relationship that binds them  together  may be true in the hypothesis that everything else is false  But this  everything else   which is contained neither in fact nor in judgment nor in relation  necessarily includes the very existence of facts as well as the logical principles implied in judgment and in relation  If there are no facts or logical principles  the chickens will uselessly lay eggs in the realm of non fact  and a relationship between fact and judgment in the realm of illogism will be futile  Therefore  the truth of one fact  one judgment and its relation implies the existence of truth as a domain that transcends and encompasses at once facts  judgments and relations    Searching for truth in fact  in judgment  or in relationship is like searching for space in bodies  their measurements  and their distance from one another  just as space is not in bodies  neither in measurements nor in distances  but bodies  measurements and distances are in space  so the truth is not in fact  in judgment  nor in relationship  but all are in truth or they are nowhere  and even this  not being anywhere   if it really means anything and is not just a flatus vocis  has to be in the truth    Truth is not a property of facts  judgements  or relationships  It is the realm within which facts  judgements and relations occur      At this point  the kantian temptation is practically unavoidable  As a condition for the possibility of facts  judgements and relationships  the truth is effectively an a priori condition  But is it an a priori condition for the existence of these three things or only for the  knowledge  we can have of them      This problem is solved in a simple and brutal way  if we say that the truth is an a priori form of knowledge and intend this statement to be true  then knowledge must be in the truth and not truth in the knowledge  because what is a priori cannot be immanent to something which it itself determines  To be an a priori condition of knowledge  truth must necessarily be an a priori condition of something else that is not knowledge  but rather its object  Knowledge  like facts  judgements and relationships  is within the realm of truth  and that is so independently of knowledge being considered exclusively in its eidetic content or as a fact  the truth of what is known  the truth of the knower  and the truth of knowing are all aspects of truth  and truth is not an aspect of any of them    After all there is no kantian way out  Either knowledge is in the truth or it is nowhere,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/hqjevx/the_problem_of_the_truth_and_the_truth_of_the/
philosophy,2020-07-12 05:13:02,Arguments Against the Provability of the Existence of God in any Sufficiently Explanatory System,hpml1t,8,11,    This post stems from my finally putting my thoughts on paper about this subject after reading and watching numerous viewpoints  The hope is to educate and inspire debate and fix any logical shortcomings  It s obviously not a complete list of reasons for the presence or absence of God as that would span multiple volumes of books  Also cross posting on some other groups to get wider feedback       TLDR  In summation  we admit that we cannot preclude the presence of stronger models and the explanatory power of science to bring empiricism into play to answer questions about the start of the Universe  and therefore  answer questions about the existence of God  Everything about the world  that was at first unknowable  has been through time and concerted application of effort been revealed through repeatedly refined scientific models  However  there may be a statement such as  God exists   that cannot be derived in this or any stronger system that is rich and effective       First Cause  A common argument for the existence of God is a deductive one using deductive logic instead of empiricism  The idea is to prove the existence of God a priori without having to resort to the need for personal experience  It s aim is to be powerful by using the rules of logic to come to the inescapable conclusion that God exists   It goes something like this   1  The universe cannot be eternal since matter cannot spontaneously arise  2  Hence  the universe must have had a starting point   3  Let s assume the starting point is not the result of another universe collapsing and starting again because then we have to answer the question of why the other universe existed  infinite regress  and we re back in the same place 4  Similarly  let s assume that the universe cannot create itself because then we wonder about the origins of the parent universe  another infinite regress  5  Hence  the universe must have been created by an entity other than itself and because the entity willed the universe into existence  it s almighty and has the ability  if it so chooses  to interact with those things that in turn originated from the universe  such as people  6  This entity is God  Note that this argument allows for an almighty God to create the universe and some rules of physics and allow the universe to unwind from these rules without active interference  It also allows for a God that is actively interfering and intervening in the day to day activities of all entities  including living organisms  in the universe        Refutations Against First Cause  Theists rely on deductive reasoning instead of empirical reasoning to show that God exists  They claim that science cannot explain the metaphysical and empiricism is irrelevant  So we must show the First Cause is illogical purely on deductive grounds  The refutation to the First Cause argument is twofold       Creator of First Cause  The argument that there must be a first cause and therefore God exists is false because invoking the presence of God to create the universe requires explaining who created God  Then  a theist may argue that we don t need to actually explain who created God   in particular  there can exist an entity who is uncaused  But then  if we admit the presence of such an entity  why does it have to be God  In particular  we can apply that deductive logic to the Universe and the Universe may be uncaused  Applying Occam s razor  there is no need to invoke God as something that needs to be uncaused         Other Explanatory Variables Besides God  Following the chain of logic in the First Cause argument  God is not the only explanation for the start of the universe  In particular  5 may not be correct   Quantum fluctuations show that particle and antiparticle pairs may be created from vacuum and it s possible that this sets forth the conditions of the Big Bang  which then explains how the universe was created  Or it s possible that another stronger model that ties together quantum mechanics and general relativity will include  as part of its predictions  conditions necessary for the start of the universe       Godel s Incompleteness Theorem  Some theists also resort to using Godel s incompleteness theorems to show that science cannot answer all questions  In particular  Godel states that a particular system cannot both be consistent and complete if it follows certain rules such as being effective and rich  Effective means a computer can made deductions following the rules of deduction and a set of axioms  Rich means the system is describing something non trival  We only care about consistent systems and therefore  the system cannot be complete   ie it cannot answer questions about the existence of God  This logic is false for a couple of reasons   1  Godel s theorem is not saying there are unprovable statements in all systems  Indeed  something which is unprovable in one system may be provable in another  However  if we take the ZFC system  which is the basis for all mathematics and is very powerful  there are statements whose truth values cannot be derived from the axioms of that system  In other words  we need a more powerful system to prove certain statements in that system  But such a powerful system may exist and in that system  the derivation of the statement  God exists  may be derived  2  If a statement cannot be proven  that does not imply the statement is true or false  It simply means we cannot   derive   the truth or falsity of the statement using the rules of the system       Existence of God May be Unknowable  It seems that there cannot be an empirical way to find out whether God exists  There doesn t seem to be any deductive logical reasons for it either  Hence  it s possible that there are no sufficiently rich and effective systems for which the statement  God exists  is provable  The statement may be provable in a system without much explanatory power   but we are not concerned with such systems here  Therefore  it s quite possible that any system that admits the explanatory power of mathematics  and therefore explains observations in the real world  will not be a system in which the statement  God exists  can shown to be provable,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/hpml1t/arguments_against_the_provability_of_the/
philosophy,2020-07-09 05:19:41,Inclination Towards Authenticity in Recognition of Manifesting the Persona,hnurx3,4,0,    The persona is that which we present through the embodiment of an underlying archetypal pattern of Being when we want someone to like us  it is the state of Being which posits the expression of what we believe would be appealing in the other person s eyes  We should be wary in this projection  or once we realize that our mode of being in relation to someone is characterized by the will to be appreciated  liked  respected  or lusted after  The mindfulness in recognizing the personas emergence is the first step towards an authentic resolution  or modification  which can be consciously directed  From this mode of being  that of the persona s dominance  it is easy for us to embellish who we are  or spin things in an appealing manner  effectively applying a mask to our true nature in the revelation of who we are  the act of doing such  is the persona embodied  If we can be mindful of entering into this mode of being  we can acknowledge our intent from which it has an end of producing  and seek to modify it  in either of two directions  We can either embellish the mask  and continue towards deception  or we can seek to be as honest as possible  Our inclination towards either one of the poles  whether it be honesty or deception  is determined by a number of factors  The amount of pride and confidence we have in who we truly are  how appealing our true nature is  how virtuous  or full of vice  we may happen to be  and our learned habits  The natural biological inclination tends towards deception  I d say  on the average  while there is an evolutionary benefit in honesty and trust  the choice depends on our temperament  acquired character trait  and circumstantial navigation  Whether or not our true nature is appealing or not  I argue  we should lean towards the side of honesty in any moment on which the persona is noticed as dominating the psyche  for multiple reasons   One reason why honesty is optimal as a corrective course to the personas emergence is that  if we do otherwise  if we continue down the path of being deceptive and putting on the mask of the persona  we not only deceive the other  but run the risk of deceiving ourselves by doing so  we contain the possibility of believing the deception  thus leading to a heightened sense of ego  and altogether  creating further dissonance between who we are and who we think we are  In addition  if we are honest in the presentation of our Being  especially in situations where we desire to be admired  the result can be beneficial to us  on an individual level  regardless of the other person s respect or admiration  as either result can tell us something about ourselves and the other person  This honesty or authenticity in modifying the persona  doesn t necessarily call for a radical truth telling  or admission of more than would be optimal for the solution  It merely points to not allowing us to be dominated by the psyche s desire to be attractive  While it isn t inherently a negative thing to be admired  or to will to be attractive to someone  we should want to do this through an authentic representation of ourselves  Oftentimes an authentic representation of ourselves does mean the compassionate navigation of truth claims  that is  not bluntly stating things  but wisely omitting unnecessary or hurtful content with the intention of the best long term result for the other person  If we truly want the best for someone  we should act so as to manifest what we believe to be the best content to display in order to aide them  The truthful authentic representation of ourselves doesn t always mean telling the truth  it means not pretending to be someone we re not  not stating falsehoods  or falsely representing our beliefs  This can be optimally navigated not through radical honesty  but through temperance and restriction  through openness to expression of who we truly are   Here we have four cases in the authentic representation of ourselves  If we present our Being honestly  to the degree that we can  and the person for whom we seek admiration responds positively  we succeed and everyone is happy and we learn that who we truly are is actually in alignment with the values of the other person  If we seek admiration from someone  it is out of desire or admiration we have for the other person  which implies that our success in gaining their admiration tells us the things we aim at are conducive the type of person we  wish to attract   If an honest approach to correcting for the personas emergence works out in our favor  we learn that the person we  authentically  are is in alignment with what we value  as we judge the other person to be someone who contains  to a degree  traits which we value   Stemming from the same framework above  if the other person is perceived as truly someone who we respect or contains virtues or traits which we value  and our persona becomes modified by a conscious intention of honesty and authentic representation of our Being  yet we are received negatively  or are rejected  it appears we have lost  But we have gained something through this knowledge  of which a critical  honest  self examination will determine the nature of  Perhaps there truly is something wrong with us  to which  further inquiry could enlighten us  and we could improve  On the other hand  in the case our authentic self is not desired by other person  perhaps we misjudged their values  perhaps the things they value truly are not the things in which we do  in which case  we no longer will desire their admiration  In either case  individually  we can grow and navigate existence  except  we are doing it from a place of authenticity     If we recognize the persona and continue under its influence  free from conscious modification in the direction of authenticity  and we are well received by the person we seek admiration from  it appears we have won  but as far as I can see  this is a loss  The persona which is accepted  and valued  is not an authentic representation of ourselves  and therefore  we can take no pride in admiration from the other person  We merely have succeeded in deception  which  as time will show  we will pay for  as there is truly nothing which goes unaccounted for  As we struggle to maintain the persona  we may fall into self aggrandizing  in delusions of grandeur  and believe ourselves to be someone we are not  leading to psychological confusion  and further distancing from psychological individualization  The fracturing of the psyche  and the domination of any given archetype  in this situation  the persona  will result in dissonance  suffering  and  on a practical note  given the relationship produced by such actions  it will inevitably fall apart as soon as the other person comes to their senses and takes a peek under the mask at our true nature  Dante denoted the innermost circle of Hell as consisting in those who partake in deception  and that is exactly what our experience will contain of once we walk down the path of self deception  On the other hand  the person we have successfully fooled  will suffer the pain of wasting time  of losing trust in another human  in effectively being  deceived   The truth always comes out  and the suffering it will cause the deceived is no arbitrary thing  it won t be good  that s for sure  and the resentment and bitterness that results from such experiences  will add insult to injury to the suffering we are already undergoing as a result of such pursuits  So we should really be wary lest we fall down this path   In the last case  if we continue down the path of deception  in the personas will manifesting itself in an inauthentic representation of ourselves  and the other person rejects us  than we find ourselves in a situation where not only did we lack the confidence to be ourselves  but the person we  thought  the other would like still was not received  meaning  not only could we not authentically be someone who is attracted by the other person  but even when we pretend to be something we aren t  we still couldn t achieve positive evaluation from someone whose perspective we value  The suffering caused from lack of confidence  the pain of failing  even though vice  may provide the groundwork of negative reinforcement towards attempting authenticity  or another mode of Being  This may be the benefit in failure  in this case  that we learn that such a pursuit is not only successful  but that who we ought to be needs to change  our strategy didn t work  and change is revealed as necessary  at least in how we present ourselves in the face of someone whose opinion we value  This leaves us in the position to assume that authenticity itself may be optimal  since this method surely didn t work out for us   We always can misjudge the character of someone  in which case we can determine by their rejection of values we contain or deem important  We also can learn if we are not the type of person who can be desired  in which case we should evaluate our flaws and set out to work  In either case  the perceived negative effect of rejection by tilting towards honesty in the projection of our persona  not only saves us from the perils of being admired as someone we are not  saves us from self deception  but offers up the Being in which we should desire to be appreciated  admired  respected  or wanted  the Being of our authentic self  who we truly are,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/hnurx3/inclination_towards_authenticity_in_recognition/
philosophy,2020-07-08 16:02:37,A Critical Analysis of Debra Satz s Four Parameters,hngnqk,1,0,I would love to know what you think about this essay written for a class  that dealt with Debra Satz s book  Why Some Things Should Not Be for Sale  The Moral Limits of Markets   Feel free to point out inconsistencies  problems  etc  as a comment to the essay     x200B     A CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF      DEBRA SATZ S FOUR PARAMETERS      x200B     INTRODUCTION    In her book  Why Some Things Should Not Be for Sale  The Moral Limits of Markets  Debra Satz proposes four dimensions to assess markets on the level of noxiousness  weak agency  asymmetric vulnerability  harmful outcomes for the individual  and harmful outcomes for the society  see Satz  pp  94 99   Weak agency refers to the inadequate information about the nature and or the consequences of a market  Asymmetric vulnerability refers to markets where a good is desperately needed  markets with origins in poverty and destitution  and markets whose participants have unequal needs for exchanged goods  Harmful outcomes for the individual refers to the market producing destitution  e g   markets that harm to basic welfare and or agency interests of the individual  Harmful outcomes for society relates to servility and dependence  When a market has harmful outcomes for society  it undermines democratic governance   In this paper  I intend to analyze the four parameters using the example of child labor  In the following  every parameter is explained  and then specific issues are highlighted  I am inclined to issue a caveat at this point  This paper and the analysis of the four parameters is based on her application of them in the chapter on child labor rather than its general application     ANALYSIS OF THE FOUR PARAMETER      Weak agency    Let us begin by describing weak agency  Weak agency  according to Satz  is the case in a  market that is characterized by very weak or highly asymmetric knowledge and agency    P  96  This description of weak agency contains four parts that we should depict further  First  weak  Second  highly asymmetric  Third  knowledge  and  fourth  agency   According to Satz  weak or highly asymmetric knowledge describes the lack of important information by direct participants of the market  Weak or highly asymmetric agency describes the serious indirect effects on people who are not involved in the market transactions   P  96   Yet  Satz does not describe what is meant by weak or highly asymmetric  Specialized philosophical dictionaries are no help in this case  as they do not contain a specifically philosophical definition  We can draw from this that Satz uses these terms in a colloquial rather than an academic philosophical manner  According to the Cambridge Dictionary  synonyms for weak are  lacking in physical strength  not strong in character  diluted  not convincing 1 This gives us an idea of what is meant  Weak is something that is not convincing or lacking the necessary strength to be convincing  Highly asymmetric  on the other hand  is a measure of comparison  Asymmetry requires something to be compared to something else  As stated in the Cambridge Dictionary  asymmetry is the  condition of not being equal or equally available between two people or groups  2 What most likely is meant by highly asymmetric in this context is a comparison between the participants of the transaction   A second part can cause some confusion  agency  Satz then adds to the confusion by stating that    a  gency problems also arise in markets in which one of the affected parties is not directly involved in the transaction but depends on others to transact for her  In such cases  we cannot be certain that the party herself actually benefits from the transaction    P  96   Again  according to the dictionaries  agency can mean twofold  Either it describes a  capacity  condition  or state of acting or of exerting power   or it describes  a person or thing through which power is exerted or an end is achieved  3 The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy provides that    i  n general terms  an agent is a being with the capacity to act  and  agency  denotes the exercise or manifestation of this capacity  4 Satz states that    a  gency failures can occur because some of the direct participants lack important knowledge or because the market has serious indirect effects on people who are not involved in the market transaction    p  96  This quote could be misconstrued as attaching the later meaning to agency  yet  I suggest  that Satz s meaning for agency is  agency as a capacity  condition  or state of acting or exerting power  for two reasons   First  the concept of weak agency shall not only be applied to situations where the person acts on behalf of someone  i e   as an agent  but more generally weak agency is also applicable to situations where a person is acting on their behalf  Second  I claim  what Satz is trying to achieve is to declare as noxious any market  where the party is going to suffer because of missing knowledge  to which we will come in a second  or cognitive capacity  i e   agency   So  then we have an idea of what is meant by the parameter of weak agency  A market scores high on weak agency if the actors in the market have very weak or highly asymmetric knowledge and agency   A third part might need just a little explanation  knowledge  According to the Cambridge Dictionary   knowledge  means the  understanding of or information about a subject that you get by experience or study  either known by one person by people generally  or the  state of knowing about or being familiar with something  5 Merriam Webster provides a very similar definition     T  he fact or condition of knowing something with familiarity    acquaintance with or understanding of science  art  technique    the fact or condition of being aware of something   or  the range of one s information or understanding  6  Knowledge is  therefore  the ability to understand information and the state of knowing the information  This needs no further discussion  as it is an unambiguous understanding that corresponds with the colloquial meaning and use of the term   Let us now have a look at the example of child labor  and how Satz argues that child labor scores high on weak agency  At the beginning of the chapter on child labor  pp  156 157   Satz describes a child as  a person who is in some fundamental way not developed  but rather developing   Because a child is still developing and does not yet have the necessary capacities to deliberate and act competently in their interests  adult parents or surrogates must  protect  nurture  and educate children   so Satz  p  157   Her description of a child to me is intuitively plausible  and I will spend no time discussing it further  Satz s reasoning is straightforward  Because a child is still developing  it is the obligation of the parent or surrogate to help the child develop  i e    protect  nurture  and educate    Because a child cannot develop him  or herself  it needs to be supported  That support should stem from the surrogate 7  Satz then claims that children cannot be assumed to have full agency  as they do not have the cognitive  moral  affective capacities of adults  nor the power within their families  and are unable to decide on the allocation of their time   P  157  This supports our analysis of the meaning of agency in the previous part  Agency as a capacity  As children do not have the cognitive  moral  and affective capacities  i e   full agency   they are unable to decide on the allocation of their time and need the help of a surrogate  I would agree with her because it is plausible that children  since they are developing  do not yet have developed their full capacities  and do not have full agency   In a second step  Satz claims that to be ascribed full agency  a child  or family member  must at least have some power within their families to make decisions  What Satz is trying to say is that children are not able to allocate their time  Instead  they depend on someone else to tell them what to do  i e   to allocate their time   Satz illustrates her premises by referring to Jane Humphries8 and points out that most children that work are put to work by their parents  p  157   The children are at their parents  mercy  She states that    w  e cannot simply assume that the head of household functions as a benevolent dictator in the interest of the family as a whole    P  158  But is the weak agency of the child relevant for the evaluation of the noxiousness of the market  Couldn t it be that the surrogate has sufficient agency to act on behalf of the child   Does all this mean that there a  child labor market  would score high on the dimension of weak agency and asymmetric knowledge  Is there weak agency in child labor markets  According to Satz  a  child labor market  differs from an ideal labor market in that the decision maker may lack important information regarding the consequences of his or her choice  This  as seen above  would fulfill the requirement for weak agency  Referring to Dreze and Gazdar 9 Satz quotes     T  he ability of parents to assess the personal and social value of education depends  among other things  on the information they have at their personal disposal    P  158   One serious moral concern of child labor  therefore  is that the decision to put children to labor is made under a lack of information about the consequences of that choice  made by the parents or a surrogate as the decision maker   This is what Satz describes as  agency problems   p  158   and what is meant to correspond and fulfill the criterion of a weak agency  It includes surrogate decisions  ignorance  uncertainty about the future cost and benefits of educating one s children   Yet  I claim there is a pertinent ambiguity that has to be addressed  Satz is not entirely clear on who has to be subject to weak agency  In the following  I shall try to understand what Satz could have meant   Let us assume  the employer and the surrogate both have no knowledge of the consequences of child labor  Is the level of weak agency still fulfilled  There are two possible answers and underlying arguments  We could argue that the weak agency is still fulfilled because the comparison is no longer  or never was  between the surrogate and the employer  but between the surrogate and the market as a whole  While this seems a possible interpretation at first glance  it adds to the complexity of our evaluation of weak agency  In every market assessment case  we would now have to evaluate the weak agency not only between the market participants but also between the market participants and the market as a whole  However  impracticality by itself is not a criterion for a reasonable criticism because there might be a plausible reason why the parameter is impractical   Yet additionally  this interpretation fails to achieve what Satz is looking for  in my opinion  Using this parameter is essentially to declare noxious any markets  or market transactions  that allows  or enables  an extreme form of knowledge inequality  It is  if you will  a market transaction that is based on deception and fraud  This parameter is not  I suggest  only aimed at markets  or market transactions  that involve the immediate participants  i e   the surrogate and the employer in the case of child labor  Not only would an extension of the subjects of weak agency make the evaluation harder  but it also fails to achieve Satz s goal  because she is trying to declare any market transaction  or market  noxious that is based on knowledge inequality   We have ruled out the first possibility  that if employer and surrogate both are equally unknowledgeable  the scope of the parameter would encompass the market as such  We can  therefore  safely assume that what most likely is meant by market participants are the actual market transaction participants  i e   the surrogate and the employer in the case of child labor    Let us instead suppose that the surrogate is fully aware of the consequences of child labor  i e   has knowledge   but the employer is not  The constellation is hard to imagine  A surrogate that is fully aware of the consequences of child labor would likely abstain from putting the child into labor  One possibility is that the surrogate out of desperation resorts to child labor  In that case  the second of Satz s parameter  vulnerability  would come into action  However  when a fully informed surrogate and an uninformed employer agree to child labor  then the parameter of weak agency would  in my opinion  not be fulfilled  Which market transaction participant is unknowledgeable seems relevant  It seems that Satz focuses on the knowledge of the party that likely is going to suffer from its weak agency  I shall  therefore  specify the parameter of weak agency in the following way  Weak agency only leads to a high score of noxiousness  if the sufferer of weak agency is also going to suffer from the consequences   A third possibility is that both surrogate and employer are equally knowledgeable about the consequences of child labor  This is a more theoretical scenario and supports my claim about the sufferer of the consequences  It shows that it is irrelevant whether the employer has knowledge about the consequences  From a purely economic standpoint  if an employer can employ a child to do the same work for less cost  then he would do so irrespective of the consequences for the child  This behavior might be unethical  but assuming we are evaluating the noxiousness of the market  we have to begin a   clean slate  where everything is allowed  Only then can we evaluate what market should either be regulated or declared illegal   Of all the three scenarios  I claim any scenario that has the sufferer of the consequences  the surrogate  or more precise the child of the surrogate  that has weak agency and knowledge is the most plausible and achieves what Satz intends   However  there is an additional criticism in Satz s conceptualization of weak agency  While Satz does mention knowledge and agency  she does not explicitly  though maybe implicitly  mention the availability and comprehensibility of information  Of course  the agency problems  i e   surrogate decision making  ignorance  uncertainty about the future cost  and benefits of education of a child  in my opinion  cannot be solved by simply providing additional information  However  what also should count is that the information is sufficient and comprehensible because even if the information is available  the information is only useful if it can and is understood by the sufferer  Only then can it at least allow the chance that a change occurs  and the weak agency and highly asymmetric knowledge dissolves   Yet  even if  as Satz states  the choice in favor of child labor is made in a fully informed and deliberate manner  this would not necessarily morally justify it   P  158 169  This an important point Satz makes  Even if the level of weak agency is not high  enough   this is only an indication that the market is not noxious  However  if a market does not contain weak agency  this doesn t morally justify the action of putting your child to labor or employing children  as there are three additional parameters to focus on  that could declare a market noxious  If poor families are facing background circumstances and options that are unjust   the option does not by some mysterious process suddenly become just    P  158  The key to the moral assessment  so Satz  is based on the moral legitimacy of the socially available choices an agent faces   P  158 159  What Satz states is that the circumstances of a family are of importance for the decision in favor of child labor  This is what Satz covers as her second dimension of assessment of market noxiousness  Asymmetric vulnerability     Asymmetric vulnerability    Satz describes her second parameter of asymmetric vulnerability as the risk of the weaker party to be exploited due to different capacities   When people come to the market with widely varying resources or widely different capacities to understand the terms of their transaction  they are unequally vulnerable to one another  In such circumstances the weaker party is at risk of being exploited    P  97   We have discussed the term of asymmetry in the previous section  The discussion is applicable to this section in the same manner  Vulnerability  though  is new  The Cambridge Dictionary describes vulnerability as  the quality to be easily hurt  influenced  or attacked  or something that is vulnerable  10 Asymmetric vulnerability exists when two market transaction participants are unequally vulnerable  according to Satz  Now  she extends the scope  As I will explain  this is problematic  Not only market transaction participants  i e   surrogate and employer  are relevant  but also others are taken into account for the evaluation of vulnerability  Satz states that this vulnerability becomes apparent either in exchanges between the children and their employers or in the situation of the family itself  According to Satz  when a family is in a precarious situation  they are more likely to take desperate steps and put their children to labor   P  159  Let us  therefore  more generally state that the more vulnerable a market participant or the direr his or her situation  the more likely a participant is to accept unfavorable terms  especially if there is no other option   and  by conclusion  the higher the level of vulnerability in Satz s framework  I agree with Satz on this point  It needs no further explanation   Referring to the practical example of child labor  Satz states that families in very dire situations are often uneducated and illiterate  and in some countries caste and ethnic division may add to the vulnerability   P  159  She then claims that the parameter of vulnerability itself can have different spheres  and expands the scope of the vulnerability further  Child labor can reflect an unequal vulnerability within families  so Satz  Some families sacrifice a working child for the sake of the other or other family members  Even more  child labor might also reflect the power and resource inequalities between the mother and the father  She states that growing evidence suggests that mothers have a stronger preference than fathers for investing in their children s welfare  including education   P  159   Satz describes three spheres of vulnerability that have an influence on child labor  The vulnerability of the child to the society and or their employers  the vulnerability of the child within the family  and the vulnerability of the child within the power struggle of the mother and the father   P  159  What Satz does not take into account is the vulnerability of the family itself or society as a whole  She does not mention factors that  in my opinion  are equally relevant to the parameter of vulnerability  Families that employ child labor are vulnerable to the society as a whole  Satz might counter that the family is vulnerable to the society as a whole does not influence the vulnerability of the child  but in this case  the vulnerability of the family as a whole will have a significant influence on the asymmetric vulnerability  For example  the status of the family within their community to be counted as honorable could have an impact on putting a child to labor to have more financial means and thereby better the situation of the family within the community   Additionally  Satz ignores the vulnerability of the society as a whole  Suppose country A is one of many yet a significant producer for clothing to country B  The prices for clothing in country B pays are so high  that they make up a significant amount of country A s GDP  Now  suppose  country B decides to look for cheaper producers in other countries  If there is no weak agency  country A is vulnerable and very likely is going to do  almost  anything to stay in business with B  This dynamic will then  so I claim  trickle down to the micro level  Where countries  families  parents  employers  or children are extremely vulnerable  and are  at the same time  market transaction participants  they are likely to participate in the market on any  or at least very unfavorable  terms offered   I believe that far more dynamic processes are in place than what Satz is able to cover with this parameter  The status within their community  the status of the family within their society  but also the status of the community within the society   This practical example of the parameter of asymmetric vulnerability  I claim  shows a relevant issue with Satz s parameter  It is difficult to define the scope  Yet  the scope of the parameter is important because it influences the results on the noxiousness of a specific market     Harmful outcomes for the individual    The third dimension of market evaluation is the level of harmful outcomes for the individual  The higher the level of outcomes for the individual  the likelier the market is noxious  according to Satz   P  94  For the example of child labor  let us also assume that to develop all your capabilities  i e   overcome weak agency   a child has to have a certain amount of education  Any education takes time   child  labor also takes time  and a child only has a finite amount of time  Therefore any time  that a child is at labor  it has less time for education and thereby less time to develop its capabilities  Referring to Amartya Sen 12 Satz states that children have two kinds of interests  welfare interests and agency interests   P  160  Welfare interest covers a child s well being  i e   shelter  food  health  education  bodily integrity  as well as a stable and loving relationship with the parents    Agency interests are not as easy to understand  but with the understanding of agency that we developed earlier agency interests describe the fact that actions have to be in favor of the child gradually developing the capabilities  i e   the capacities  to  set goals for themselves  and to choose and act by their own values    P  160   It is necessary  so Satz  that parents protect and provide for these interests because children are not yet able to do so by themselves   P  160  Satz states that there are basic agency and well being that have to be fulfilled  and failure should be considered abusive to the child  It could hinder the development of crucial adult capabilities  According to Satz  child labor that violates these basic interests13 should or could constitute extreme harm for the individual  i e   the child    P  161   As a third moral concern of child labor Satz sets the stage with the following quote   The nature of the damage generated by child labor markets depends on the form of child labor    P  159   There are several issues to be discussed with this parameter  First  like with the other parameter  it is not entirely clear what she means by  individual   Take the situation of the child and its surrogate  Who has to suffer from extreme harm  The child or the surrogate  Satz seems to refer to the harm that child labor has for the future of the child or stated more generally in the terms we have used above  The harmful outcomes for the individual refer to the outcomes for the actual sufferer of the market  This becomes clear when looking at the fourth parameter  harmful outcomes for the society   which by contrast covers any outcome on other subjects  including family members  the society  other people  etc  Yet  Satz does not state it unambiguously   The second issue with this parameter of harmful outcomes for the individual is that we can t reliably foresee the outcome of a certain market  It seems to be a silly argument because  in the case of child labor  most people would agree that it has harmful outcomes for the child  However  in other cases  the harmful outcomes might not be as obvious  Suppose you have a market for X  and X won t show its outcome for the individual until 50 years from now  How do you evaluate that harmful outcome  In most cases  you would rely on empirical research  And in the case of child labor  there is plenty of evidence of the harmful outcome on the child  But what if you do not have any empirical research on the specific market  and no comparable market is available  My criticism again concerns the practicality  The importance and use of the parameter  I do not contest  How it actually should be used  is more controversial  because the outcome relies on several factors  Satz does provide context by stating that especially the violation of basic interests constitutes an extremely harmful outcome for the individual  But in markets with which we have little previous experience  this parameter becomes hard to assess  I assume that the assessment of this parameter  as perhaps with all parameters  is based on an  intuitive qualitative  rather than an  analytic quantitative  assessment  This puts Satz s framework at danger of being unintentionally diluted by subjective views  biases  and experiences of the assessor   Let me summarize  I agree with Satz on the importance of the parameter of harmful outcomes for the individual  However  I doubt that this parameter is as easy to evaluate  as shown in the case of child labor     Harmful outcomes for the society    As a fourth dimension  Satz claims that where a market has harmful outcomes for the society  the noxiousness of this market is likelier  On a social level  child labor can generate harm even for a society  so Satz  Children that grow to be uneducated  illiterate  and passive adults cannot contribute to social development   P  162  Therefore  the existence of child labor may inhibit the long term productive development        needed to help the poor move out of their desperate circumstances or to raise up the wealth of a nation    P  161 162  Again  my criticism with this parameter is similar to the one made on harmful outcomes for the individual  What exactly is the scope of this parameter  How should it be measured  Perhaps even more extreme is the evaluation of long term consequences for a society as opposed to the individual  I have to reiterate my concerns of the previous parameter  Satz assesses this parameter in an  intuitive qualitative  rather than an  analytic quantitative  manner  This puts her framework at danger of being unintentionally diluted by subjective views  biases  and experiences of the assessor     Summary    Concluding the paper on Satz s four parameters as used in the cased of child labor  we can state the following  On weak agency and asymmetric knowledge  we first clarified the meaning of the terms  Then tried to identify who has to be subject to the weak agency or suffer from asymmetric knowledge  We concluded that for the parameter of weak agency or asymmetric knowledge scores high if the sufferer of the weak agency or asymmetric knowledge is also the sufferer of the consequences  Additionally  I drew attention to the missing reference to sufficient and comprehensible information to mitigate the weak agency and asymmetric knowledge   On asymmetric vulnerability  we stated that  generally  that the more vulnerable a market participant is or the direr his or her situation  the more likely a participant is to accept unfavorable terms  and the higher the level of vulnerability  We drew our attention to the fact that Satz extends the scope by including the vulnerability of the child to the society  to the employers  and also the vulnerability of the child within the family  Yet  we criticized that Satz s scope is not broad enough  It does not  or only implicitly  include the vulnerability of the family within the society  the vulnerability of the family within their community  or even the society as a whole  All these elements have a trickle down effect on the vulnerability of the subject  We have pointed out that it is difficult to define the scope of these parameters  yet the scope of a parameter is crucial because it influences the results of our assessment   On the harmful outcome for the individual  we have concluded that it refers to the actual sufferer of the market transaction  and criticized that harmful outcome is difficult to evaluate as it often lies far in the future  On the harmful outcome for the society we have  again  criticized that the scope is extended  yet  not entirely clear on how to be evaluated   As a general criticism  I have stated that some parameters  or perhaps even all parameters  seem to rely not on an  analytic quantitative  evaluation not on an  intuitive qualitative  evaluation  which puts Satz framework at danger of being unintentionally influenced by subjective views  biases and the experiences of the assessor  However  in conclusion  the framework does act as a solid first stepping stone in the reasoned assessment of markets  especially in cases where markets endanger the social democratic structure   1    2    3    4    5    6    7 In what follows  I shall refer to any parent or surrogate as  surrogate    8 Jane Humphires  1999  argued that there is no infans economicus  i e   that children lack the capacity to think in economic terms    9 Dreze  J  and H  Gazar   Uttar Pradesh  The Burden of Inertia   In  Indian Development  Selected Regional Perspectives  ed  J  Dreze and A  Sen  Delhi  Oxford University Press 1996  p  86   10    12 Sen  Amartya   Well being  Agency  and Freedom  The Dewey Lectures 1984   Journal of Philosophy 82  no  4  1985   169 221   13 What Satz also highlights is that we have to favor the  basic interests  standard over the so called  best interests  standard that some children s advocates have proposed to assess child labor  because the  best interests  standard has two disadvantages  First  she states  there is no widely shared view of what constitutes a child s best interest  and is therefore open to widely different interpretations  Second  the  best interests  standard according to Satz assumes that parents are  mere instruments for optimizing their children s interests   Satz claims that moral standpoint is wrong   There is no inherent injustice in family structures that assume that children must make some contribution to the well being of the family    p  161  This  in my opinion  is a statement that bears little explanation  It is understandable that children have to do their part  chores  in maintaining a good family life  as soon as they are old enough and capable  But and I think from what Satz says this could be inferred  the chores of a child have to be age and capacity appropriate  In most cases a child would even learn a thing a two that would provide to them to lead a successful life in the

philosophy,2020-07-07 07:26:33,The Flies and Spiders Fallacy,hmnok5,28,19,I enjoy reading about philosophy and thinking about logic and I think I ve identified a really common fallacy people make in arguments  but I don t know if anyone has ever defined it or given it a name so I d like to  forgive me if this is already a thing and I m just ignorant    Originally  I was going to call this  The Sub Set Fallacy of Mistaken Transitivity  because I feel smart saying that and because it literally describes what the fallacy is  but after reflecting on other fallacy names like  the straw man fallacy  or  the hot hand fallacy  I decided to give it the more simple name   The Flies and Spiders Fallacy   To understand this fallacy  you need to understand what  the transitive property of equality  is and what  subsets  are  I ll explain the transitive property in the next paragraph and what subsets are in the following one  If you know what one or both of these things are  feel free to skip either or both of these next paragraphs   The Transitive Property of Equality is a simple concept to understand  Literally it is defined as  If A B and B C then A C   To put this in a real world context  imagine you re putting a shelf on a wall  You measure the part of the wall with a measuring tape  Now the measuring tape is the length of the part of the wall  Then you cut a peice of wood to the length of the measuring tape  If the measuring tape is the length of the wall and the cut shelf is the length of the tape then you can trust that the shelf will be the length of the wall  This reasoning is called  transitivity    Now you need to understand subsets  A subset is a category within a category  You may remember learning that all squares are rectangles  but not all rectangles are squares  You can describe this relationship by saying  squares are a subset of rectangles   Another example is bugs and insects  When bugs have 6 legs  they are called insects  All insects are bugs  but not all bugs are insects because arachnids  like spiders  exists and they have 8 legs  With this said  lets talk about my fallacy   The Flies and Spiders fallacy happens when people try to make a transitive property argument  but rather than using things that are equal  they use things that are subsets of each other and are not totally equal  Hear is my example of this Fallacy   All insects are bugs  All arachnids are also bugs  So insects must be arachnids  With that said  flies are insects and spiders are arachnids and therefore flies are spiders   Flies are obviously not spiders and this is a silly example  but I see this structure of argument too frequently for it to not have a name   Recently with the Black Lives Matter movement  I see a lot of post saying  BLM tear down statues and the government looks away just as Nazis tore down statues  How can we let modern Nazis do this in America      This takes the same structure as the  flies are spiders  argument  Throughout history  many people have taken down statues for different reasons  BLM is a subset of  statue removers  and Nazis are a subset of  statue removers   but because these things are subsets and are not totally equal you cannot logically use a transitive argument   I d love to see your examples of The Flies and Spiders Fallacy because the internet is riddled with them  Thanks for reading,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/hmnok5/the_flies_and_spiders_fallacy/

philosophy,2020-06-23 07:08:47,Haidbauer Incident and Wittgenstein s Philosophy,he7o0j,5,11,Hello all   As one of the most preeminent philosophers of the 20th century  the name Ludwig Wittgenstein is often mentioned on this subreddit  His ideas such as language games  private language  and forms of life continue to be topics of discussion for many contemporary philosophers  Wittgenstein has become somewhat venerated  and as far as modern philosophers come  is the closest to being sanctified  Bertrand Russell referred to him as  the closest thing to a perfect genius I ever saw    But it only takes a cursory look at Wittgenstein s personal writings or behavior for one to be immediately appalled   I know that human beings on the average are not worth much anywhere  but  here they are much more good for nothing and irresponsible than  elsewhere   This is just one of many examples of Wittgenstein s elitism evidenced in his letters   One example of his holiness often presented is the time he gave up his wealth as one of the richest men in Austria to become a rural schoolteacher  This sounds rather egalitarian  but the reason Wittgenstein became a schoolteacher was to demonstrate in praxis some of his philosophical ideas  As a thorough logician  he believed since mathematics was axiomatic  he could teach a group of school children advanced mathematical concepts  If one reads his Tractatus  you can see how Wittgenstein s mind operated at this point from step 1  2  3  etc  Villagers from that area would refer to Wittgenstein as  that totally insane fellow who wanted to introduce advanced mathematics to our elementary school children   Some had a high opinion of Wittgenstein  especially since he would use his resources to take the children on museum trips to Vienna  however one of the students was the developmentally challenged Josef Haidbauer  who could not comprehend Wittgenstein s lesson plans and in return was boxed around the ears by Wittgenstein  Some may say this was just standard punishment at the time  but this is not so  He clearly went far beyond any normal  smack on the wrist with a ruler   Wittgenstein hit Haidbauer so hard  that he was knocked unconscious  Haidbauer was the son of a single mother  who worked as a maid on a farm  The farmer acted as a sort of surrogate father  and when he found out about what happened   he was livid and basically went to go kick his ass  But Ludwig  being a rich Viennese aristocrat  fled to the city   He was prosecuted for this act  And in court  Ludwig Wittgenstein  the great proponent of logical atomism  perjured himself to avoid further criminal liability  This incident is not one of the things that jumps to mind when one thinks Wittgenstein  The reason I bring this up is because it clearly had a monumental impact on Wittgenstein himself  who referred to himself as a coward due to his behavior  The philosopher famous for attempting to investigate logic itself down to its atomistic constituents felt  nauseated  at the idea of being examined in court   I m not bringing this up to sully his reputation  my point is  Wittgenstein perjuring himself clearly had a major impact on his philosophy  which is often regarded as esoteric  but in light of the Haidbaeur incident  it becames far more understandable  The  shift  between early and later Wittgenstein which so aggravated analytical positivists  when he seemed to undermine his own previous statements  Language for Wittgenstein went from being a  tool  to being a  game    private language   the malleability of language   Courts are where people are supposed to be held to a set deontological ruleset based on ethics  truths  morality  etc  When he saw that he lied and got away with it  he realized that language is much more complicated than just a simple tool  It has the ability to be shifted or warped depending on the  game  one is playing  Clearly  Wittgenstein couldn t just write  I ve been thinking an awful lot about that time I beat up a developmentally disabled child then lied about it  and what this may mean in terms of truth values   Haidbauer couldn t speak for himself and had no resources  the fact that couldn t communicate made Wittgenstein so angry that he beat him  There was a problem between the two based on miscommunication in their forms of life  and I think this directly influenced Wittgenstein s main theses  that there are no philosophical questions  only miscommunications in language which philosophy seeks to clarify  Discussion of pain and mental states appears in philosophical investigations as well  In trying to understand the differences between himself and Josef Haidbaeur  I believe Wittgenstein began to philosophically investigate the underlying ways language is used on an every day basis  which led him to realize language can mean different things to different people depending upon situational context   tl dr  Wittgenstein beating a child and lying about it made him think about the ways language can be manipulated  which opened the doorway to his later philosophical investigations,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/he7o0j/haidbauer_incident_and_wittgensteins_philosophy/

philosophy,2020-06-12 19:54:49,Philosophy of the African American Experience  Readings and Lectures ,h7ogxn,26,2,Hello  r philosophy   With the recent political events  I thought it prudent to post a list of publicly accessible sources for those who wish to education themselves on the problems of race in America  More specifically  these readings are aimed to provide a basic understanding of the philosophical conditions that enabled racism to both exist and flourish in the United States  as well as providing philosophical accounts of the lived black experience in America from the times of slavery through modern times  These sources are derived directly from a class titled  The Philosophy of the African American Experience  that I found to be extraordinarily illuminating in grasping the basic understanding of not only the lived black experience  but seeing how deeply rooted racist ideology is in American society   The intention of this post is to provide relevant readings  lectures  and interviews  in chronological order  for individuals with no previous background on the subject to be able to pick up and go through a journey of philosophical thought    Each reading will be accompanied by a  Reading Commitment   which  as it suggests  gives an approximate amount of time one would have to dedicate to complete the reading from start to finish      Full disclaimer    these readings are meant to provoke thought in the reader  Some of it is considered to be highly offensive by today s standard and the apologies put forth by some of the authors are passionate and moving  If these readings anger you  make you question racism  or provoke you to want to learn more    this post has served its purpose    This is by no means an exhaustive list  There is a TON of reading material on the subject  but I found these not only easily accessible  but they are structured in such a way that a reader can follow the progression of philosophical thought  Additionally  I will provide a small list of lectures   interviews at the end to either supplement the reading or enable those who do not wish to read to get acquainted with some of the ideas presented in the readings      Readings    1785   Thomas Jefferson s   Notes on the State of Virginia    Ch  14     Begin at      To emancipate all slaves born after passing the act   End at     When freed  he is to be removed beyond the reach of mixture     Reading Commitment  10 15 minutes     1829   David Walker s  Appeal  Reply to Jefferson        This link includes the entire appeal  However  I recommend using that link simply for the Preamble and then reading  Article I  Our Wretchedness in Consequence of Slavery   and then  Article II  Our Wretchedness in Consequence of Ignorance    Reading Commitment for Preamble  Article I   II  35 65 minutes     1857    Dred Scott v  Sandford       Important a pivotal case for black rights   Here   is the Khan Academy video that also explains it   Reading Commitment

reference     1866    America s First Civil Rights Act       This provides the reader some of the constitutional changes that came as a result of the civil war  Of the numerous public sources  this seems to hit it the best as it summarizes a great deal of information   Reading Commitment  25   120 minutes    Varied due to multiple links within the read itself       1880 s   Alexander Crummell s   We Need Character        This takes you to a google search  The first link from Dialnet gives an automatic PDF download  Relevant pages are p  5 16 on the PDF  This also gives a nice bibliography at the end for further readings  I originally intended to link  The Negro as a Source of Conservative Power      but I could not find this online  The link provided gives a summary of Crummell s thoughts  There is also a nice  SEP   article  but might be much for an introductory reader   Reading Commitment  25 60 minutes     1845   Frederick Douglass   Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass  An American Slave         Full book here  but a great read for understanding the lived experience of being black during this time  Suggested Reading      Chapter 7   PDF pp  50 56    Reading Commitment

45 75 minutes     1895   Booker T  Washington s  Atlanta Exposition Speech       It would be a good exercise to compare the thoughts of Washington and Crummell as they both have different approaches to the problem of racism   Reading Commitment  10 15 minutes     1896   Plessy v  Ferguson  Short Version   and  Long Version       Another pivotal case   Reading Commitment  short   10 15 minutes     Long   45 65 minutes     1903   W E B Dubois   Souls of Black Folk  Ch 1   and  Ch 3       Chapter 1 is titled  Of Our Spiritual Strivings  and Chapter 3 is  Of Mr  Booker T  Washington and Others    Reading Commitment  Ch 1  25 45 minutes    Ch  3  30 60 minutes     1952   Frantz Fanon s   Black Skin  White Masks         This is an excellent read  but we need not read it all  Here  we begin to hit philosophical altitude of the lived experience of being black  This reading can be challenging for introductory reading  but is more accessible to those who have read everything up until this point  There is a lot to unpack here and it is suggested to watch some of the supplementary lectures listed below AFTER reading the text  Suggested readings as follows      Introduction   PDF pp  40 46    Reading Commitment  15 25 minutes    Chapter 1   The Negro and Language    PDF pp  47 66    Reading Commitment  45 75 minutes    Chapter 5   The Fact of Blackness    PDF pp  121 147    Reading

1963   Martin Luther King Jr   Letter from Birmingham Jail    Reading Commitment  30 45 minutes     1964   Malcolm X  The Ballot or the Bullet       Similar to the comparison of Crummell and Washington  it would be a good exercise to compare the thoughts of Martin Luther King Jr  and Malcolm X   Reading Commitment  30 45 minutes     1967   Kwame Ture   Charles V  Hamilton   Black Power  Politics of Liberation in America         Similar to  Black Skin  White Masks   this another excellent and powerful read  However  for our purposes we will focus on the first two chapters  Suggested readings as follows     Chapter 1   White Power  The Colonial Situation    PDF pp  20 35    Reading Commitment  45 75 minutes    Chapter 2   Black Power  Its Need and Substance    PDF pp  38 48    Reading Commitment  35 60 minutes     1982   Cornel West  A Genealogy of Modern Racism       It should be noted that West is a prominent public intellectual and if you find this reading enjoyable  he has many other works  This essay hits on some philosophical topics that may require some follow up and secondary reading  so I advise researching some of the ideas afterward to solidify the understanding   Reading Commitment  45 65 minutes      1988   Peggy McIntosh  White Privilege  Unpacking the Invisible Knapsack       If have not read anything above  read this short essay as it gets some major points across  This is simple  succinct  and will get you thinking   Reading Commitment  15 25 minutes     2000   Lewis Gordon   Existentia Africana        This is a higher level philosophy read that will be inaccessible to those who did not do the prior reading  but I am linking it in the event that someone did trudge through all of this and wanted to see higher level thought  If you did not do the readings  worry not  Go ahead and skip to the lectures  Gordon  among being a great writer and brilliant philosopher  also has good lectures  For those who wish to try their hand at this  you will find that Gordon references almost everything above in some fashion  Suggested Reading      Chapter 1   Africana Philosophy of Existence    PDF pp  14 34    Reading Commitment  75 90 minutes    Chapter 2   A Problem of Biography in Africana Thought    PDF pp  35 53    Reading Commitment  75 90 minutes    Chapter 3   Frederick Douglas as an Existentialist    PDF pp  54 74    Reading Commitment  75 90 minutes   As previously mentioned  this is not an exhaustive list  but a start  I suggest taking these readings bit by bit over time and keeping in mind that these were spread out over 16 weeks  Gordon s reading is by far the most difficult  but fruitful  Either way  I commend anyone who spends even an hour clicking through some of these links and reading on a subject that they previously may not have known to exist      Lectures   Interviews  For those who did not want to read or for those who want to supplement their readings  here are a few lectures that are fruitful to watch in understanding the subject at hand  Again  this will not be exhaustive  but is supposed to help acquaint someone with the philosophical thoughts concerning race in America

philosophy,2020-06-05 23:40:35,On category mistakes and metaphor with presuppositional theory,gxcm5q,2,0,In this essay  I would like to address an analysis of category mistakes  More specifically  I would like to address them through an argument from metaphor  For the purpose of this essay  I will speak of category mistakes as metaphors    There are two types of arguments from metaphor that were being discussed in Ofra Magidor s  Category Mistakes   One type is that metaphors do not require literal meanings  This is to say that was is stated in the metaphor is not its literal meaning but what it says pertains to something else  The second type is that metaphor requires literal meanings  This states that what is said in a metaphor is its literal meaning  If a metaphor has a literal meaning it is then meaningful and so are category mistakes in the same way    With regards to the first type  saying a metaphor does not have a literal meaning but something else that it denotes misses the point of a metaphor  This type of theory is like describing an abstract painting to someone and never showing them the painting  You could explain every detail of the picture and would be left with two scenarios  If your description is not perfect then you will miss something like the  emotion in the brush strokes   or at least give a barren description of them  If you were somehow to capture the entirety of the picture in words  the listener would have no need for your words thereafter  One theory of substituting and expanding the metaphor substitute expands  her eyes were diamonds  as  her eyes were bright  shiny  clear  etc    If this were the  metaphorical  meaning of the sentence  it is just that this alternative is another literal meaning  The use of the word diamond could be said to have a secondary use  However  what is special about a poetic phrase is how the words play and relate to each other  To paraphrase lacks the poetic effect or at least has a different one  You will never be able to describe what  her eyes were diamonds  meant more perfectly than  her eyes were diamonds    Expansive descriptions of what someone meant by  her eyes were diamonds  will fall short  For these reasons  I will be discussing the second theory in which metaphor has a literal meaning  More specifically I will use the presupposition account offered by Ofra Magidor in which the felicity  or infelicity  is predicted by what is taken for granted   Note Standard typical context  how words are used generally everyday baring special cases   Datum 1    Colorless green ideas sleep furiously   Noam Chomsky   This famous example originally used as something that is both grammatical and according to Chomsky meaningless  Under the framework present by Ofra Magidor it is infelicitous  In the first section  colorless green  it is taken for granted that the green is a color and thus cannot be colorless  In this regard  because of the presupposition is a color   colorless green  suffers from a presupposition failure and is then infelicitous  Another tied part of the sentence  green ideas  also suffers from presupposition failure as ideas are  in standard context  not taken to have colors  I take the  green idea  to not be an idea about something that is green  Ofra Magidor states that  sleep furiously  exhibits a presupposition failure as  in standard contexts speakers take for granted that sleep is performed with no emotion    1     This is where it starts to get a little sticky as we head more towards poetry and metaphor  The presupposition becomes harder to discern though I believe it still possesses the rigor to do so  So called  standard context  loses its governance the further we stray from everyday speech  I intend to show this is how it should be   Datum 2    Juliet is the Sun   Romeo   This 19th century poem is filled with a type of category mistake likened to one talked about by Ofra Magidor except her version was  the number 2 is green   I see these as similar as both numbers and letters are presumed in standard context to not have a color  The standard context is the things that are normally taken for granted in discussions of things of letters  This is what is presupposed and when this fails it is considered infelicitous in standard context  The statement  E is white  would be infelicitous through presupposition failure if you were talking about the spelling of  electric eel  and said   Well E is white and electric eels are not so there can t be an E in its spelling   This would be both wrong and infelicitous  Still  the context of a poem is given special attention  This poem was investigated by French literary scholar René Etiemble in which he came to the conclusion of  Why  flies    tents    lips    bugles   Because the poet has seen them  Why has he seen them  because he is a poet        This original symbolism  which is impossible to reconstruct  to formulate in an equation  must be accepted  must be submitted to    2    Datum 3    Dreams    Langston Hughes  Hold fast to dreams  For if dreams die  Life is a broken winged bird  That cannot fly  Hold fast to dreams  For when dreams go  Life is a barren field  Frozen with snow   At first glance and in the typical application of language it seems infelicitous to  hold onto dreams  or that  dreams die   It is taken for granted that a  dream  is not something tangible and  holding  is typically reserved for something tangible so one would expect this to be a presupposition failure  Of course  this is so if operating with the standard presupposition of the word s  hold  and  dream   However  this is poetry  and leeway is to be given to the poet  a prominent theme to come   The metaphors expressed in this poem must be taken as literal meanings under the presupposition account  The way the words play and intermingle within the poem conveys a message  This message can be analyzed but not paraphrased adequately enough so that the poem should not be needed to convey the same message   Datum 4    Vowels  by Arthur Rimbaud  English translation   A black  E white  I red  U green  O blue  vowels    I shall tell  one day  of your mysterious origins    A  black velvety jacket of brilliant flies   which buzz around cruel smells  Gulfs of shadow  E  whiteness of vapours and of tents    lances of proud glaciers  white kings  shivers of cow parsley    I  purples  spat blood  smile of beautiful lips   in anger or in the raptures of penitence   U  waves  divine shudderings of viridian seas    the peace of pastures dotted with animals  the peace of the furrows   which alchemy prints on broad studious foreheads   O  sublime Trumpet full of strange piercing sounds    silences crossed by   Worlds and by Angels       O the Omega  the violet ray of   His   Eyes    This 19th century poem is filled with a type of category mistake likened to one talked about by Ofra Magidor except her version was  the number 2 is green   I see these as similar as both numbers and letters are presumed in standard context to not have a color  The standard context is the things that are normally taken for granted in discussions of things of letters  This is what is presupposed and when this fails it is considered infelicitous in standard context  The statement  E is white  would be infelicitous through

must be accepted  must be submitted to    2    Datum 5    China cat Sunflower    written by Robert Hunter performed by The Grateful Dead  Look for a while at the China Cat sunflower    Proud walking jingle in the midnight sun  Copperdome bodhi drip a silver kimono    Like a crazy quilt stargown through a dreamlike wind    Crazy cat peekin  through a lace bandanna   Like a one eyed Cheshire  like a diamond eye jack A leaf of all colors plays a golden string fiddle   To a double E waterfall over my back    Comic book colors on a violin river cryin  Leonardo  Words from out a silk trombone    I rang a silent bell  beneath a shower of pearls    In the eagle winged palace of the Queen Chinee     This is one of my favorite songs and I was very grateful  pun  that it was rife with category mistakes such as  violin river crying   midnight sun   words from out a silk trombone   These are often described as nonsense lyrics although that prescription does not quite fit if you considered their origin  First  though  a  violin river crying  if taken in standard context or in everyday use would be infelicitous  Generally  crying is normally used for something that is able to cry  like a baby and a river does not belong to such things that generally cry  What a  violin river  means is even harder to understand as violins are generally taken to be instruments and in conversation about violins  it is taken for granted that they are instruments  If you said  a violin sings  it would make more sense as  sings  is a musical term and in discussion with other musicians saying an instrument sings is hardly infelicitous  A  violin river  is clearly infelicitous in normal use as none of the things taken for granted with  violins  and  river  would show that a  violin river  is proper use  With  midnight sun  it is presupposed that midnight happens at night when the sun is not out so there is a failure in presupposition too  However  consider that the lyrics were written by Robert Hunter while lying on his back with a cat on his stomach under the influence of powerful psychedelics in which the cat showed him everything in the song and it becomes pretty clear that in that context the lyrics are  unimaginably  felicitous     Theories of category mistakes are supposed to correctly predict the felicity or infelicity of a given category mistake  The candidate offered by Ofra Magidor is that of presupposition  The felicity of category mistake seems to be due to what is presupposed or taken for granted  Difficulties do arise is determining what is properly presupposed for a category mistake to be  in felicitous  e g   the number 2 is green  is felicitous in a discussion where numbers are presupposed to be colored   However  this difficulty does not seem to be the result of the theory itself being faulty  Rather the difficulties arise in one s ability to see within which game you are playing  Standard or typical contexts  typically taken for granted or believed  see many category mistakes to be infelicitous  However  in poetry especially   standard contexts  and what someone believes is to be taken for granted need not always apply  One problem raised is that this account requires that category mistakes have literal meanings  If they are taken to be metaphorical in design  then I believe this is the case  Still  special attention must be granted to metaphorical literal meanings  The meanings are literal  but they are not a sum of their parts  Replacement in the poet s speech fundamentally changes the metaphor  The meaning exists in how the words play with each other and taken out of context they lose the sense in which they do this  It is often said that poems and metaphors speak about things unutterable and more importantly they do not try to push this envelope  Some things are said in silence  I will finish this essay with a quote that I feel summarizes what I mean by this  After reading Uhland s poem  Graf Eberhards Weissdorn   Wittgenstein comments  The poem by Uhland is really magnificent  And this is how it is  if only you do not try to utter what is unutterable then  nothing  gets lost  But the unutterable will be  unutterably  contained  in what has been uttered     3      x200B     1    pg 145   Category Mistakes       2   Rene  Etiemble   Le Sonnet Des Voyelles  De L Audition Colore e A La Vision Erotique

philosophy,2020-06-05 01:52:22,Heidegger s attitude towards Nietzche s Death of God,gws9dv,11,2,The paper will articulate Nietzsche s statement God is Dead  I will do this by describing the attributes of both incomplete nihilism and complete nihilism   1   Furthermore  I will offer the perspective of Heidegger s attitudes in both agreement and disagreement with Nietzsche s strategy in the wake of the Death of God   For Nietzsche  the devaluation of the highest values is considered to be incomplete or passive nihilism  For Nietzsche  incomplete nihilism  its forms  we live right in their midst  The attempts to escape nihilism without revaluing the former values  they produce the opposite  make the problem more acute    The Will to Power  no  28   To get this point across  one should envision  God  in a sort of place in the supersensory world  Through us  the death of God creates a vacancy in the place of the highest values  The now vacant place of the hitherto highest values still belongs to the supersensory world  This incomplete nihilism puts  nothing  in the place of the highest values  It is incomplete in the sense that it still acknowledges and thus keeps a separation between the sensory and supersensory  In turn  this keeps a highest value in that sense   2   However  it is still a necessary step towards a fulfilling life not based on the supersensory world  The highest of values  belonging to the supersensory world  create a separation between them and the sensory world  In this sense  they devalue themselves from the real or sensory world  This is not to say that unbelief in God is the essence of nihilism but just a consequence as we will see later  Heidegger states   metaphysics  through Nietzsche  has deprived itself of its own essential possibility in certain re spects   Heidegger   Nietzsche s word  God is Dead  pg 157   Metaphysics is used in the same sense as the supersensory by Heidegger   For Nietzsche  the devaluation of the highest values  is considered to be incomplete or passive nihilism  For Nietzsche  incomplete nihilism  its forms  we live right in their midst  The attempts to escape nihilism without revaluing the former values  they produce the opposite  make the problem more acute    The Will to Power  no  28   Through us  the death of God creates a vacancy in the place of the highest values  The now vacant place of the hitherto highest values still belongs to the supersensory world  This incomplete nihilism posits  nothing  in the place of the highest values  It is incomplete in the sense that it still acknowledges and thus keeps a separation between the sensory and supersensory  In turn  this keeps a highest value in that sense   2   However  it is still a necessary step towards a fulfilling life not based on the supersensory world   The next step to a complete nihilism is an attempt at the revaluation of all values  subtitle of the  Will to Power    This means to say that one should take all values out of any other  world  into the scope of the sensory world in subjectivity  For subjectivity and value to be understood properly  it is important to briefly go over some crucial aspects of the will to power as it is how Nietzsche comes to understand value   The question then becomes  How one can lead a fulfilled life in the wake of this nihilism  It would have to be on the basis of the will to power as the fundamental driving force of life understood by Nietzsche  For the will to power  there is the will to more power which it sees as possibilities  This is part of the increase and the becoming which is in essence the will to power as described previously  For this  conditions are to be met in order for the will to obtain the possibilities as possible somethings of transitions to increase to  It is a necessary condition of possibilities to have the creation of possibilities and thus a condition of creation lies in the essence of the will to power as a necessary condition for increase in the same sense  This creation is for Nietzsche the essence of Art  As Heidegger puts it  The essence of art  grasped on the basis of the will to power  is the fact that art excites the will to power toward the will in the first place and spurs it to will above and beyond itself    Heidegger   Nietzsche s word  God is Dead  pg 180   Nietzsche then sees  value  as conditions for preservation increase with preservation increase belonging properly to the individual as willing the subject to individual evaluation  Subjectivity with respect to value  can be understood as seeing something in a way or a viewpoint  Therefore  with respect to the subjectivity of the will to power  values are seen from a viewpoint as conditions of the will to power in scope of the viewpoint of  the  will to power  The revaluation of all values then means that the values are now under the consideration of the will to power to see  subjectively  which are the  proper  conditions for preservation increase  Proper as in what the will to power sees as sufficient or necessary durables and durable to be obtained for preservation increase  preservation and increase    The next step is the transition from incomplete nihilism to complete nihilism or active nihilism  This is done via a new dispensation of values  This is also to say one has new values in mind  As stated previously  the revaluation of all values means that the values are under the consideration of the will to power to see  subjectively  which are the  proper  conditions for preservation increase  From this can come the new dispensation of values which are seen as conditions for preservation increase in the viewpoint of the will to power  This is in contrast to the pre devaluation dispensation of values where  God  in the supersensory sense holds its own value as the highest   Heidegger   Nietzsche s word  God is Dead  pg 167   3    For Heidegger  a Dasein  humankind of being  in everydayness is being in the world  This is living in accord with the they self or what y  do  It is opposed to coming to grips with its being in the world as for Heidegger it is anxious about its true self  With the coming to grips with being in the world  Dasein can step outside of being in the world and question the unauthenticity of the they self and can come to grips with being in its entirety and see the unauthenticity on a whole  Seeing that it is unauthentic one can bring themselves into scope with the horizon of being by stepping out by questioning and can possibly return from this stepping outside and can lead an authentic life  It can continue doing so by questioning its being in the world sense  This creation is for Nietzsche the essence of Art  As Heidegger puts it  The essence of art  grasped on the basis of the will to power  is the fact that art excites the will to power toward the will in the first place and spurs it to will above and beyond itself    Heidegger   Nietzsche s word  God is Dead  pg 180   It is then  for Nietzsche  that one can live a fulfilled life because of the will willing to go beyond itself to fulfill the possibilities created by art on the basis of the will to power  The will to power intrinsically contains the condition of art as a means of creating possibilities  It can become fulfilled for an instant as the possibilities created are reached but then comes out of fulfillment as the condition of art then creates new possibilities for the will to power to be reached  In this continual sense  a life lived in this way is in constant flux of fulfillment and thus is fulfilling   Since it is subjective  the will to power  through art can reach what it views as fulfilling in all possibilities such as a certain style to be developed  An appeal to a certain ideal as aesthetic becomes another possibility created by art   In one  sense  Heidegger would agree with this way to live a fulfilled life  The  way  articulated above is the devaluing of the highest values into the revaluation into the dispensation of new values with respect to the will to power and the new values as conditions of preservation increase to reach the possibilities created by art and being fulfilled when such possibilities are met  Heidegger agrees with this is in the sense that the revaluating of all values is likened to looking at metaphysics or looking at the horizon of being in its entirety   For Heidegger  a Dasein  humankind of being  in everydayness is being in the world  This is living in accord with the they self or what y  do  It is opposed to coming to grips with its being in the world as for Heidegger it is anxious about its true being With the coming to grips with being in the world  Dasein can step outside of being in the world and question the unauthenticity of the they self and can come to grips with being in its entirety and see the unauthenticity on a whole  Seeing that it is unauthentic one can bring themselves into scope with the horizon of being by stepping out by questioning and can possibly return from this stepping outside and can lead an authentic life  It can continue doing so by questioning its being in the world     3   In the text there is an initial dispensation value before the revaluation of values and then describes a further dispensation of values  I take the initial dispensation to be the dispensation of the values in the scope of the hitherto highest values not being authentic to oneself for Heidegger and for Nietzsche not living in accord with the new dispensation of values as conditions for the will to power  The stepping outside to grasp being in its entirety is for Nietzsche the revaluating of all values in the sense that they are both coming to grips with for Heidegger  being in its entirety and for Nietzsche  values in its entirety  The dispensation of new values in scope of the will to power after the completion of nihilism in order to reach the possibilities created by art can be likened to living an authentic life for Heidegger as they are both a type of subjective acknowledgment of their own essence and conditions for a fulfilling life   However  there is a fundamental difference in their thinking  This is in regard to Heidegger s view of Nietzsche s nihilism  For Heidegger  the supersensory world  God as such is also Metaphysics as he uses those word interchangeably in  Heidegger   Nietzsche s word  God is Dead   Heidegger thinks that for Nietzsche  nihilism being the highest values devaluing themselves is metaphysics depriving itself of its own possibilities to which he states   since metaphysics  through Nietzsche  has deprived itself of its own essential possibility in certain re spects  and therefore to that extent other possibilities of metaphysics can no longer become apparent    Heidegger   Nietzsche s word  God is Dead  pg 157   This for Nietzsche is a metaphysical reversal and is left in an inverted state of non essence  This  then for Nietzsche is the countermovement against metaphysics  However  Heidegger states that  as a mere countermovement  however  it necessarily remains trapped  like everything anti   in the essence of what it is challenging   Heidegger   Nietzsche s word  God is Dead  pg 162    This is to say that since it is going against metaphysics  as the horizon of being in its entirety  it becomes trapped and thus entangled in metaphysics with no way out   in fact  it is em broiled in it to such a degree that it is sealed off from its essence and  as metaphysics  is unable ever to think its own essence  This is the reason that  for and through metaphysics  there remains hidden what actually happens in and as metaphysics itself    Heidegger   Nietzsche s word  God is Dead  pg 162   In this sense  that the nihilistic reversal of metaphysics into non essence  is not possible in Heidegger s view which shows the fundamental difference in their thinking   Citations      Nietzsche   The Will to

philosophy,2020-05-29 09:03:57,Disproving an Invalid Reality Theory  The CTMU,gsn76z,0,1,I would like to disprove the CTMU using some logical reasoning  But before I do  I ll say that I m glad I can contribute  To start off  the CTMU  Cognitive Theoretic Model of the Universe  says to be about using self determinism as a  middle ground  for solving the dichotomy of causal determinism and non determinism  Okay    But that s the flaw in it though  because self determinism is not a complete idea in and of itself  Clearly  it can be symmetrically mirrored to what is its dual in a higher dimension of causality  or to its dual in definition to self determinism   so to what is called outside the self determinism  making anti self determinism a real thing in possibility    But a  valid theory of determinism or of causality wouldn t be just combining a couple of old concepts into something else that is wrong just as well  in any case  Maybe though  a valid theory of causality could be about something called all determinism  but self determinism is simply wrong  it s incomplete as an idea    Notice how I don t deny that determinism and non determinism aren t completely related yet in standard reality theory  though  The CTMU says the same thing but then messes everything up  I d say  In other words  the M R principle in the CTMU is obviously false as a principle of reality BECAUSE the dualism of mind and reality is real in possibility just as much  It could actually be half of the real picture  though  Anyway  why else could I talk about it  if it wasn t real at all    Chris Langan is simply making what was originally a problem of dichotomy or lack of a relation between two things into an even bigger problem by heightening that same problem s complexity  It s like someone fused together Quantum Mechanical theory with Einstein s General Relativity  but only succeeded half of the way  But then  Langan also uses the CTMU to unfortunately disapprove of homosexuality for example  and he disapproves of atheists and democrats as well  all while disapproving of a bipartisan leadership    To explain a little further  the CTMU has to be wrong from its very basic premise of self determinism as formulating all of reality because the word  all  was replaced for  self   in the formulation of the CTMU being treated as a theory of everything  And  self   according to Langan  IS Langan  Also  conspansion is a false model of physical spacetime and is backwards thinking  Things must be expanding WHILE contracting in two symmetrical parallel universes if his idea is to work  as both are possibilities and one doesn t make sense without the other   but he denies universe expansion just as much as he denies externalized forms of determinism    I could even write a paper for a theory of everything that is far more valid than Langan s CTMU right now  too   about causality in dimensions Langan has probably never thought of  As for disproofs of the CTMU  however  I m just glad that I could contribute to what s on the internet right now  since no one else seems to be able to debunk the CTMU in an in depth  logically thorough way  Now  Langan is smart but he is simply wrong with the CTMU  Anyway  I ll leave this post at that  And I don t mean to attack Langan here  I respect him   but I do wish to disprove his theory with this,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/gsn76z/disproving_an_invalid_reality_theory_the_ctmu/
philosophy,2020-05-27 02:00:20,All philosophical models proposed to solve the logical problem of the Trinity are unsuccessful as they lead to heresy already identified within Church history  The principle of the twofoldness of divine truth is a better approach to understanding the Trinity and how to respond to the logical problem,gr7ppu,4,25, No introduction needed as title sets out purpose of post     Modalism    According to the modalistic concept of the Trinity  the Father  the Son  and the Holy Spirit are purely adjectival not equally and eternally co existent  but three successive manifestations of God  or three temporary modes of his activity  This denies that God in his own inner being is triune  Rather  it claims that the Father  Son  and Holy Spirit are either temporary or successive roles adopted by God in carrying out the divine plan of redemption and that they in no way correspond to anything in the ultimate nature of the Godhead  Chadwick  1968   Modalism does not recognize Christ s independent personality but sees his incarnation as a mode of the existence or manifestation of the Father  Bethune Baker  1929    Modalists hold the Father  Son and Spirit only refer to the way in which God reveals himself but bear no relation to his inner being  Bruce  1953   Sabellius  fl  ca  215  was  by far  the most original  profound  and ingenious of the modalists  Schaff  1950   His theology was essentially that of Noetus  Noetus taught that for Christ to be God  he had to be identical with the Father  Kelly 1960    but being more carefully worked out  a definite place being given to the Holy Spirit as well as to the Son  Walker  1959   Sabellius seems more concerned than those before him in preserving the unity of God  claiming strongly that God is one person as well as one substance  McGiffert 1931   Sabellius taught  the Father  Son and Holy Spirit are all one and the same  three different names of the one God who manifests himself in different ways according to circumstance  As the Father  he is Creator  Governor  and Lawgiver  as the Son  he is incarnate as the Redeemer  and as the Holy Spirit  he is the Inspirer of the Apostles  the Regenerator and the Sanctifier  Walker  1959     For Sabellius  he is the one and same God  the one and the same divine person  who acts out in all these ways  appearing in successive and temporary manifestations  the same way a human individual may have different titles to denote their various roles  Walker  1959    McGiffert 1931     God does not act as Father  Son and Spirit at the same time  but successively  turning from one activity to another as required  with one and the same God appearing now as the Father  now as the Son  and now as the Holy Spirit  but never all at the same time  Walker  1959    McGiffert 1931    Bethune Baker  1929     Crucial to Sabellius  thought is that God s unity unfolds itself in the course of the world s development in three periods of revelation  and after the fulfilment of redemption returns again into unity  Schaff  1950   His teaching was that the revelation of the Son ends with the ascension  and that the revelation of the Spirit continues in regeneration and sanctification  Schaff  1950   The Trinity of Sabellius is not a Trinity of essence  that is  of the inner being of God  but of revelation  Father  Son and Holy Spirit are simply designations of three different transitions under which the single divine essence reveals itself  Bethune Baker  1929   Sabellius differs from orthodox doctrine  the Father  Son and Holy Spirit being temporary phenomena  which have roles  after the completion of which led to a return of an abstract entity  Schaff  1950     Sabellius denied that the Father  Son  and Spirit eternally co exist in the inner being of God  Rather  he argued that the Father  Son  and Spirit are merely temporary and successive manifestations of the one person of God  In the words of J  F  Bethune Baker  expert in the history of doctrine  for Sabellius   there is no real incarnation  no personal indissoluble union of the Godhead with the manhood took place in Christ  God only manifested himself in Christ and when the part was played  and the curtain fell upon that act in the great drama there ceased to be a Christ or a Son of God   Bethune Baker  1929       Tritheism     As a sharp contrast to modalism  tritheism is the belief in three Gods  especially in the doctrine that the three persons of the Trinity are three distinct Gods  According to tritheism  the Father  Son  and Spirit are three separate Gods  Even today  some say that the Father is one God  that the Son is one God  and that the Spirit is also one God  This is tritheism  Latent tritheism is common among believers mainly due to the use of the word person  Speaking on this matter W  H  Griffith Thomas said     Like all human language  it is liable to be accused of inadequacy and even positive error  It certainly must not be pressed too far  or it will lead to tritheism  While we use the term to denote distinctions in the Godhead  we do not imply distinctions which amount to separateness  but distinctions which are associated with essential mutual co inherence or inclusiveness   Thomas  1930     It is the case talk of three persons in God often leads to understanding of three separate consciousness  spiritual vitalities centres of activity etc  This danger is increased by the fact discussion of person in scholarly works on the Trinity is derived from experience and philosophy  independent of the doctrine of the Trinity in revelation and history    A form of tritheism is represented by the doctrine of Arius  In Arius  formulation  the Father was fully God  the Son had the status of the leading creature  and the Spirit was inferior to the Son  Although for Arius the divine status of the Son and the Spirit was uncertain  his formula must be considered as a type of tritheism  Turner  1969   The teaching of Arius was controversial in the early decades of the fourth century  The controversy became so intense that at the invitation of the Emperor Constantine  the Council of Nicaea convened in 325 A D  to settle the dispute among the churches of the empire over the doctrine of the Trinity  The main issue was between Arius with his form of tritheism and Athanasius with the Trinity  The Nicene Creed that resulted from this council overthrew the heresy of Arius and tritheism with an anathema at the end of the creed  Gill  2019   The teaching of Arius aroused a great controversy in the early decades of the fourth century    By the time of the Council of Nicaea  both modalism  especially that of Sabellius  and tritheism had been defeated  However  since the time of Basil of Caesarea  Gregory of Nyssa  and Gregory of Nazianzus  A D  320 395   known as the three Cappadocians  there was a tendency toward tritheism  Because of this  more than two hundred years after the Nicene Council  drawing from the ultimate consequences of the Aristotelian logical terminology of the universal and particular another form of tritheism appeared in the teaching of Johannes Philoponus  who pushed the distinction between the Father  the Son  and the Spirit to an extreme  saying that there were three essences in the one common essence of the Godhead  This was virtually tritheism  Frank  1953    tritheistic tendencies are always never far from the Cappadocian doctrine of the hypostases  each of the three persons of the Trinity  as contrasted with the unity of the Godhead       Co inherence as a solution    Eventually the Fathers developed the doctrine of co inherence  which is the intercommunion and interpenetration of the persons of the Godhead  Co inherence denotes the mutual indwelling of the three persons whereby one is as invariably in the other two as they are in the one  Just as three sciences such as Physics  Biology and Chemistry interpenetrate each other  Physics fundamental grounds upon which Chemistry and then life Biology are built  entailing interpenetration at various levels of analysis  and God permeates the Universe  so much more each person interpenetrates the others  The key to this doctrine is mysticism  experience of God as Trinity subjectively   rather than the logic of the divine relations  Turner  1969     Co inherence is man s attempt to grasp the relationship between the three persons and to explain how they have one essence  John of Damascus wrote in his Exposition of the Orthodox Faith    the Son is in the Father and the Spirit  and the Spirit in the Father and the Son  and the Father in the Son and the Spirit  but there is no coalescence or co mingling or confusion   Damascene  749     Augustus H  Strong has argued on this matter that the Scripture s representations of this intercommunion make it difficult to conceive of the distinctions of Father  Son and Holy Spirit as entailing separation between them  The intercommunion explains Christs designation as the Spirit and the Spirit as the Spirit of Christ  Strong 1912   For Strong the persons of the Holy Trinity are therefore not separable individuals  each involving the other  the coming of each the coming of the others  This means the coming of the Spirit involved the coming of the Son  Strong 1912   The doctrine of co inherence  therefore  avoids the extremes of modalism and tritheism     The Logical problem of the Trinity    Having outlined the extremes of modalism and tritheism and laid out co inherence as the way to avoid these extremes I will now turn to the logical problem of the Trinity  Within the Athanasian Creed  the following three theological theses on God as Trinity can be found     1  We worship God in Trinity and Trinity in Unity    Neither confounding the persons nor dividing the substance    2  So the Father is God  the Son is God  and the Holy Spirit is God    3  And yet they are not three Gods  but one God   Molto  2017    The logical problem that arises from this can be characterized in the following way    1 Each person of the Trinity is distinct from each of the others    2 Each person of the Trinity is God   3 There is exactly one God   Craig  2005      These three together have the implication that three distinct beings are identical with one being  which is incoherent  A series of strategies to overcome this incoherence  from the social  constitution and psychological models of the Trinity will now be assessed     The social model of the Trinity    In the gospels  the first two persons of the Trinity are referred to as Father and Son  Social Trinitarians have argued this suggests the analogy of a family  As a solution to the logical problem of the Trinity they claim the persons of the Trinity might be thought of as one in the same way the members of a family are one  they are three individual human beings but taken together they are a single family  McCall  2010   I find this line of thought unpersuasive   for one thing the relation between Father and Son is more than just familial  it denotes a role which entails the other s existence   the Father cannot be a Father without the Son and the Son cannot be the Son without the Father  Furthermore  any family unit one can give as an example  contains members which are not only distinct but also separate  separate consciousness will emotion etc  from one another  thinking of the persons of the Trinity as separate from one another in the same way members of a family are will lead to either latent or explicit tritheism  It also falls short in securing unity amongst the persons of the Trinity  there are versions of polytheism such the children of Chronos in Greek mythology  of whom Zeus was the liberator  and these children included Zeus  Hera  Ares  and other Olympian deities all members of a divine family  Nobody thinks that this divine family can be thought of as one God though  McCall  2010    Advancing beyond this social Trinitarians have noted other relations that hold between members of the Trinity that contribute alongside there being members of a single divine family to their counting as one  Richard Swinburne has argued several facts in conjunction with one another is enough to secure unity amongst the divine persons  They share the essential characteristics of divinity  omniscience  omnipotence  omnibenevolence and so forth  There is also the relation between the persons  wills being necessarily harmonious  so that they never conflict with one another and the perfect love with necessary mutual interdependence amongst the divine persons  Mutual dependence is taken by Swinburne to be equivalent to co inherence  Swinburne therefore holds that there is one God because the community of divine persons are so closely interconnected  that  although there are three distinct persons they function as if they were a single entity  McCall  2010     Swinburne takes it as far as to claim that there are three  rather than only one  divine individuals  Marilyn McCord Adams has described his thought here as follows  three numerically distinct souls of the Divine essential kind  each instantiating the universal Divinity  each inevitably everlasting but individuated from one another by relations of origin   Adams  2006   On this perspective it is the same essence of divinity that makes the Father  Son and Spirit all God   1      Swinburne  1994     What I take to be a key issue with Swinburne s model is its assumption that mutual dependence is equivalent to co inherence which is false  co inherence also entails the Father  Son  and Spirit inseparably and mutually indwell each other  not just a relation of interdependence  As Bishop Bull has said on the matter of co inherence  The co inherence of the Divine Persons is indeed a very great mystery  which we ought rather religiously to adore than curiously pry into    It is a union which far transcends all other unions   Bull 1851   Swinburne s attempt to reduce co inherence to mere mutual dependence  I therefore find insufficient  and as such think it is unsuccessful in allowing one to identify as Trinitarian and Monotheist at the same time    Stephen T Davis s social Trinitarian approach of recognizing co inherence as mutual indwelling  interpenetrating and merging has more merit  however Davis more readily recognises the Trinity is at bottom mysterious  beyond philosophical rigour to capture in doing so  McCall  2016   The model also has a short falling as it relies solely on co inherence to ward off accusations of tritheism  however co inherence is not the sole way that the three of the Trinity operate  there is also the role of incorporation  Incorporation accommodates the mutual existence  mutual indwelling  and mutual operation in the immanent existence and in the economic activity of the three persons of the Trinity  Incorporation therefore sees the work of the three as inseparable to accomplish what is distinct to one person alone  the carrying out of the divine economy via action of the three by what they are and what they do meaning that when one acts they incorporate the operations of the other two in manifest action  This means each can be identified with the other with no compromising of the eternal distinction among them  Lee  1996     An instance of incorporation is that the second person of the Trinity the Son was crucified and resurrected from the dead  not the Father or the Spirit  however it is the case that the Father and Spirit were not separate from Christ still operating in him as he was crucified  Christ offers himself through the Spirit  entailing the Son in himself could not accomplish his crucifixion  the Spirit one with the Son who died on the cross with the Father and by the Spirit  The death of Christ was not only the death of the man Jesus but the death of the Son with the Father and by the Spirit  The scriptures testify both that the Father and the Spirit raised the Son on the third day  however  they also testify that the Son rose from the dead  This recognises two things  in his humanity God raised Jesus from the dead  whereas from the consideration of him as God we are informed  he himself rose from the dead  The crucifixion and resurrection of Christ is therefore an operation of the entire Trinity which is divinely incorporated  Lee 1990   the co inherence and incorporation of the Trinity far beyond the ability of these models to capture   Swinburne s model also fails in capturing the oneness in expression and function of the Triune God which goes beyond mere aligning of will or indivisibility for logical reasons between the persons   as the scriptures identify that one is another and the three are used interchangeably in relation to man s experience of God  God relates to man in a threefold manner  not a collective entity which makes the Trinity  but the Trinity itself  freely and gratuitously communicated  Brian Leftow has criticised Swinburne s model similarly on the grounds of worship as it only makes sense if directed to someone who is aware of being addressed  however collections are not conscious so one cannot worship Swinburne s collective save as a way to worship its members  McCall  2010     It also requires a commitment to the belief that the Son exists in the same way that creatures exist  only due to the Father conserving him in being and not ending him  This is because Swinburne views each person of the Trinity as a discrete substance  distinct being  even when he sees the Son as casually dependent on the Father  Moreland and Craig note that as the Son is viewed as a distinct substance from the Father  the Father s begetting the Son therefore amounts to a creation ex nihilo  which as Arius claimed makes the Son a creature  Craig and Moreland 2003   This is wholly inadequate as in the Gospel of John the relationship between the Son and the Father can be seen  For example  in John 1 14  the only Begotten from the Father  the Greek word for  from  is παρὰ  para   which means by the side of  implying with hence  it is  literally  from with  Strong  1890   This means that the Son not only is from God but also is with God  On the one hand  he is from God  and on the other hand  he is still with God  This is contrary to Swinburne s understanding of the Son existing due to the Father conserving him and not ending him    As for the unity of will among the three divine persons on this model  this does not support Trinitarianism for three separate Gods who were each omnipotent and morally perfect would similarly act cooperatively  so Swinburne s reasoning can lead one to conclude tritheism just as easily as Trinitarianism  Craig and Moreland  2003   Swinburne may respond to this critique  that this concern is dealt with by the Farther being the source of the other persons ensuring a guaranteed coordination in their wills  whereas if they were three Gods there could be two equally optimal  mutually exclusive ways of proceeding  wherein one God might will one way  while another differently  My concern with this response is that until a specific example can be given  or possible world constructed wherein this takes place  such a possibility must be disregarded and therefore one has to assume the God s having the same nature and attributes would lead to them acting cooperatively  Craig and Moreland even go as far as to claim that if Swinburne s arguments against the possibility of dissension are correct this must be so  Craig and Moreland  2003    Other social Trinitarians have attempted to give different accounts of what unifies the divine persons  One such account is the part whole model   2     C S  Lewis s version of this analogy has it that God is three Persons while remaining one Being  just as a cube is six squares while remaining one cube  J  P  Moreland and William Lane Craig have argued that the relation between the persons of the Trinity can be thought of as analogous to the relation we might suppose to obtain between the three dog like beings that compose Cerberus  the mythical guardian of the underworld  Each of the three heads  or each of the three souls associated with the heads is a fully canine individual  and yet there is only one being  Cerberus  with the full canine nature  three persons of a type  and still one dog  McCall 2010     There are two main issues with this approach  first  like with Swinburne and Davis s accounts it does not get one to the co inherence  incorporation and oneness in expression and function of the triune God as a whole that is needed amongst the divine persons to avoid the extremes of modalism and tritheism  More significantly it would lead one to think that there were three essences in the one common essence of the Godhead as was with the teaching of Johannes Philoponus   3     leading to latent or explicit tritheism  Lewis s cube example is also problematic  for one thing a cube is a seventh thing in addition to its six sides  but God cannot be thought of as a fourth thing in addition to his triune nature  Murray and Rea  2012      The Psychological Model    Looking to the human mind or  psyche  has also been sought to help understand the doctrine of the Trinity  Augustine proposed that the oneness and threeness of the Godhead is like the oneness and threeness of the human self  Augustine claimed the oneness of the Father  Son and Holy Spirit is like the oneness of the mind  thoughts   heart  emotions  and will of a person  Augustine therefore holds we cannot have intellectual insight of the Trinity directly and that the created human mind which is made  in the image and likeness of God  as seen in Genesis 1 26 28  is a reflection of the Trinity  More extensively the mind is seen as somehow corresponding to the Father  Son and Holy Spirit in the following ways    lover  loved object  the lover s love for that object   the mind  its knowledge  its love   the mind s remembering itself  understanding itself  and willing itself   memory  understanding  and will   the mind s remembering God  understanding God  and willing God   existing  knowing that one exists  loving the fact that one exists   Tuggy 2016    These are taken to be pictures of the Trinity  the last three being more accurate  however when it comes to representing God Augustine holds them to be  immeasurably inadequate   Tuggy 2016    There is a major problem with Augustine s line of thought  the Father  Son and Spirit are three distinct persons  not three distinct aspects of one person  The mind  heart and will are three aspects of the human soul  the three of the Trinity are distinct yet inseparable  the same yet different  The danger here is modalistic Monarchianis if Augustine s analogy is taken to its extreme implications  like all analogies it breaks down  and it is at this point imo   As Adolf Harnack  has said on the matter   we can see that Augustine only gets beyond modalism by the mere assertion that he does not wish to be a modalist  and by the aid of ingenious distinctions between different ideas   Harnack 1976   Furthermore  Harnack draws attention to the fact Augustine held the view that the Godhead is personal and is consequently one person  being unable to overcome the contradiction in affirming the three persons in one essence at the same time  Harnack 1976    Thomas V  Morris has claimed we can find an analogy for the Trinity in the psychological condition multiple personality disorder  just as a single human being can have multiple personalities  so too can God be one yet exist in three persons  Others have advocated the view we can conceive of the divine persons with an analogy of the separate spheres of consciousness that result from commissurotomy  This is a procedure sometimes used to treat epilepsy and involves the cutting of the corpus callosum by which the two hemispheres of the brain communicate  Under certain kinds of conditions  they display psychological characteristics that suggest they have two distinct spheres of consciousness  associated with the two hemispheres of their brain  This analogy is used to demonstrate that just as one human being can have two distinct spheres of consciousness  so too the one God can exist in three persons  each of which is a distinct sphere of consciousness  Murray and Rea  2012    What merit there is in being able to present real life cases to help solve the logical problem of the Trinity must be dismissed as this understanding will lead to either latent or explicit modalism  In both examples given there is multiple personalities or spheres of consciousness within one person  but these personalities and spheres are not co existent  rather they are mere manifestations  With multiple personality disorder the different personalities are all temporary  each one ending as a different one emerges  and with the distinct spheres of consciousness they only emerge temporarily under certain experimental conditions  This would lead us to understand the Trinity as merely three successive manifestations of God  which is modalism   4     the co existence  and co inherence of the divine persons in one another required for the Trinity not being met with this model  Another interpretation is that each of the hemispheres sustains its own stream of consciousness  co existing with one another  This would lead to latent or explicit tritheism as the consciousness would be separate from one another  despite being grounded in one person  whereas the persons of the Trinity are inseparable yet distinct      The Constitution Model    Another solution proposed is that of relative sameness  This argues that things can be the same relative to one kind of thing  but distinct relative to another  More formally    Relative Sameness  It is possible that there are x  y  F  and G such that x is an F  y is an F  x is a G  y is a G  x is the same F as y  but x is not the same G as y   Murray and Rea  2012    If this claim is true  then it is open to us to say that the Father  Son  and Holy Spirit are the same God but distinct persons  Advocates have suggested that reflection on cases of material constitution for example statues and the lumps of matter that constitute them  help us see how two things can be the same material object but otherwise different entities  If right then  by analogy  such thought can also help us to see how Father  Son  and Holy Spirit are the same God yet three different persons   Consider the Bronze statue The Thinker  It is a single material object  but it can described as both a statue  which is one kind of thing  and as a lump of bronze which is another kind of thing  The statue is also distinct form the lump of Bronze  For example  if the statue were melted down  we would no longer have both a lump and a statue  the lump would remain though in a different shape  but Rodin s Thinker would no longer exist  This suggests an intuition that the lump is something distinct from the statue  as they can exist apart from another only if they are distinct  If correct  then this is not a case in which something appears in two different ways or is referred to by two different labels it is a case in which two distinct things occupy the same region of space time  By analogy the Father  Son  and Holy Spirit are the same God but different persons in just the way a statue and its constitutive lump are the same material object but different form matter compounds  Murray and Rea  2012    As Daniel Molto has concluded in his defence of a logic of strong relative identity  there has to be a utilization of logic in which absolute  universally reflexive  identity does not occur as a primitive and cannot be introduced by definition  This leads to a rejection of the relation of identity  and in particular giving up Leibniz s Law  It is also necessary to give up on any semantic account  which attaches absolutely individuated values to terms  This means giving up the possibility of genuine singular reference  Molto  2017    The fundamental problem with the appeal to relative identity  however  is that relative identity is widely seen as problematic  For one thing one cannot give an example other than the Trinity where allegedly relative identities cannot be analysed in terms of classical identity  With the example of the Thinker statue there is not an identity statement at all  for the Thinker is not literally a lump of Bronze rather it has a property of bronze  It is also the case that the lump of bronze is more fundamental than the statue  persisting whatever shape the bronze assumes whereas the statue will not  This entails that the statue is a manifestation of one kind of the underlying reality  hence the example is inadequate for providing a model of the Trinity  Furthermore  suppose that two things x and y could be the same N but could not be the same P  In this case x could not fail to be the same P as x itself  but y could  Therefore  x and y are discernible meaning they cannot be the same thing  This means that they cannot be the same N  since they cannot be the same anything  identity must therefore be absolute  Craig and Moreland  2003    Theologically there are issues too as it commits one to a part whole relation  also problematic for Lewis s social Trinitarianism  within the Trinity wherein no one person is identical to the whole Trinity  Craig and Moreland  2003   This therefore entails the claim that no one person of the Trinity is fully God  As already presented though co inherence and incorporation entail just this claim and give explanation for scriptures identifying each person as the other  This gives the basis for the Eleventh Council of Toledo affirming   Each single person is wholly God in Himself    the Athanasian Creed   to acknowledge every Person by himself to be God and Lord    and the Fourth Lateran Council that   each of the Persons is that reality  viz   that divine substance  essence  or nature       what the Father is  this very same reality is also the Son  this the Holy Spirit   Craig and Moreland  2003    A key example from the scriptures is Colossians 2 9 which says  in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily  indicating the Son is therefore the fullness of the Godhead  God himself   the fullness here denoting God s very essence  which is his substance  This refers not just to the entirety of the triune God  but all that the triune God  is  has  does  knows  can do  has done  has obtained  has accomplished  and has attained   Lee  1987   As the divine Trinity is the fullness of the Godhead this makes Christ the mystery of God  Lee 1983   confirmed in Colossians 2 2 which says   The mystery of God  Christ   He is the mystery of the Word of God in eternity past as seen in John 1 1 which says   In the beginning was the Word  and the Word was with God and the Word was God   This word of God became flesh  divinity and humanity joined to form a God man  the mysterious divinity being brought into humanity  the mysterious fullness of the Godhead which dwells bodily in this mysterious God man  Lee 1963  being far beyond the comprehension of human reason  and ability of a philosophical model to capture     The Twofoldness of Divine Truth    Having assessed the most popular models of the Trinity intended to solve the logical problem of the Trinity and found them at best unpersuasive and at worst opening the possibility to heresy   5     I will now present an alternative approach  Modalism and tritheism stress in an unbalanced way one aspect of the twofold truth of God s revelation in the Bible  Modalism takes one aspect of the truth   that there is only one God  and pushes it to a heretical extreme  tritheism  takes another aspect of the truth of God s revelation  that he is one in three  and pushes it to the opposite heretical extreme  If we see the principle of the twofoldness of divine truth  we can easily avoid these extremes and still maintain a testimony faithful to the whole truth of God s revelation in the Scriptures   Robert Govett  1813 1901  was a British theologian  influenced by the Plymouth Brethren  who authored the principle in his work  The Twofoldness of Divine Truth   The work is not widely read having but has played a significant role in the teaching of Watchman Nee and Witness Lee  which entailed reading in China due to a Watchman Nee translation of the work into Chinese  Lee 1991  and still holds influence among strains of the Brethren  As such it is a work that has not been engaged with by western Christian Philosophers  and it s important to note the context for the work is one wherein divisions were being formed within the church by various denominations taking the extreme of either side of a matter of truth   6       Govett speaks on this twofoldness saying  The twofoldness of truth as offered to our view in Holy Writ is one strong argument of its not being the work of man  It is the glory of man s intellect to produce oneness  It is to trace different results to one principle  to clear it of ambiguities  to show how  through varied appearances  one law holds  Anything that stands in the way of the completeness of this  he eludes or denies   Govett  undated     But   as Govett continues   it is not so with God  In nature he is continually acting with two seemingly opposed principles    Govett  undated   Examples Govett gives of this are the two forces that keep planets moving in order around the sun  being two forces pulling each particle of matter in two opposite directions at the same instant  leave it to one of them and the Earth would fly away into space  to the other it would be drawn down to the surface of the sun  Another is how life is supported by two airs or gases of opposite qualities  to breath one of them alone we would die in a few minutes  but together life is sustained  He notes even the salt eaten by humans is a compound of two substances  either of which alone would destroy us  Govett  undated   Of importance is the fact Govett s examples still hold true to this day  and there are even more that science has discovered since his time  Of important note is that Govett s examples don t have incoherence of the kind presented by the logical problem of the Trinity  rather they demonstrates our inability to reduce the laws governing nature into a single underlying principle or law clear of ambiguities  there is not a single law governing nature but ones wherein two forces or developments in opposition harmoniously and wondrously work alongside one another    There are therefore two distinct cases of twofoldness  cases wherein there are two opposed principles which cannot be reduced to a single underlying principle which operate in the world and cases wherein there are two opposed principles which cannot be reduced to a single underlying principle where we cannot grasp how they operate in the world  The examples that one can produce from our scientific study of nature largely take on the form of the first case  whereas from study of the scriptures examples from the second  The primary reason for this is that the realm of scientific and biblical require different tools for engagement  the sciences being grasped through mind  whereas the biblical is grasped via the spirit  For Govett we can experience God as Trinity  however we cannot grasp how it is God is Trinity in our mind  whereas with the natural realm of science we can both experience  via experimentation for deeper realms  and grasp it in our mind    More recent examples of twofoldness arising from the sciences are the fundamental opposition of general relativity  GR  and quantum mechanic  QM   The Final Contradiction  undated  and several forces within nature working in opposition to each other such as the strong nuclear force and weak nuclear force acting and balancing each other  the cosmological constant acting as a repulsive force in space time balanced by the Higgs Field and the balance between matter and antimatter in the universe  Hainline  2015    These examples from nature give the account merit in that twofoldness within nature is evidence of the twofoldness of the Trinity as it raises its probability relative to what it would be otherwise  It also gives the account predictive power in the following two ways  it predicts that scientists will not be able to reduce instances of two opposed principles or laws to an underlying principle or law within nature  and that the number of examples one can cite of opposing principles or laws within nature increases as our scientific knowledge of the world grows  For the purpose of this post however it is more important that the twofoldness holds in the scriptures as it will support a Govettian reading as well as ensuring the failure of alternatives  Presenting the twofoldness in the scripture and producing an inductive argument alongside the twofoldness in creation in favour of it  and then defending the argument from possible objections will now therefore follow      Twofoldness in the Word    Discussing the matter of twofoldness  Govett says   It is not then to be wondered at  if two seemingly opposed principles are found placed side by side in the Scripture   Unity in plurality  plurality in unity  is the main principle on which both the world and the Scripture are constructed   Govett  undated   Regarding the apparently irreconcilable statements in God s Word  Govett remarks   It is not necessary to reconcile them before we are bound to receive and act upon the two  It is enough that the Word of God distinctly confirms them both   Govett  undated   As Govett says   The claim on our reception is not that we can unite them  but that God has testified both   Govett  undated   Many debates regarding the truth in God s Word are unnecessary  for  as Govett states   Opposite views of truth arise from different parts of the subject being viewed at different times   Govett  undated   In relation to revelation Govett says   Thus does God try His people  will they trust him when He affirms that view of truth which runs counter to their temperaments and intellectual bias  or will they trample on one of His sayings in their zeal for the other  The humble  child like saint will acknowledge and receive both  for his Father  who cannot err  testifies to each alike   Govett  undated     Applying the principle to the nature of God Govett wrote   The same twofoldness of truth appears in the Scripture statements concerning the nature of God  It affirms His unity    But the Scripture as plainly affirms the distinction of persons in the Godhead   Unity in plurality and plurality in unity  is the assertion here  This master truth  which takes its rise in the nature of the Godhead  flows out into all His works   Govett  undated    Note Govett s statement that this  master truth   takes its rise in the nature of the Godhead   In other words  God s revelation in the Scriptures  being twofold  is an expression of the very nature of God himself  The two aspects of God s being   that he is the Three being one and the One being three   are testified by the twofoldness of the truth of his revelation in the Scriptures  Examples given in the wider scripture of the principle include God s Sovereignty and Man s Responsibility   The Extent of Redemption  The Perseverance of the Believers  Justification by Faith or by Works  The Character of God  The Nature of the Saviour  Christ s divine and human nature    The Status of the Saviour  Worship  Means of Edification  The Spirit of Worship  The Means of Grace  The Church  The Dispensations of God  and The Word of God    continuing in comments

philosophy,2020-05-26 18:41:57,The Proudhon Bastiat Debate  1849 1850  Reconstruction and critical appraisal of Bastiat s argument in favor of rent interest,gqzecr,11,9,In  Capitale et Rente   Bastiat attempts to establish the legitimacy of interest rent  Bastiat asks us to consider three separate scenarios  the first involving a farmer named Mathurin  the second  a house maker named Mondor  and the third  a tool maker named Jacques  Each one of these workers is said to toil day and night  the first producing a bag of wheat  the second a house  and the third  a plane  Each one is said to be intent on making use of the thing created immediately after completion  When  after much hardship  these workers complete their respective projects  a personage rudely intervenes and demands to use the tool for the period of one year  without offering the worker any compensation for the loss of the tool besides promising to return the tool in exactly the same condition within a year   These scenarios serve a specific purpose within the context of his argument  Indeed  after reading each scenarios  one is left with the intuitive sense that the worker  whether it be Mathurin  Mondor or Jacques  has been treated unfairly  perhaps even deeply disrespected  After all  it is at precisely the moment when the worker is about to collect the benefits conferred upon them by their tool that access to the tool is abruptly cut off and that the benefits of the tool are conferred upon another person   one who is both undeserving and selfish  Undeserving because they played no part whatsoever in the creation of the tool  and opportunistically request access to the tool the moment it is about to be put to use by its creator  Selfish because they deny the maker of the product access to the benefits which flow from their labor  depriving the maker of the very advantages which motivated them to create the thing in the first place  I think it is fair to say   and this  I believe is what Bastiat is counting on   that anyone reading these scenarios will find it all but natural that the worker be compensated for the loss of the benefits to which they are now being denied access  compensation which must reach beyond the simple returning of the thing being borrowed  It is this sense of moral indignation which accompanies the  privation  of the worker that Bastiat mobilizes in order to establish the legitimacy of rent   Bastiat s scenarios are misleading because they are not structurally similar to the capitalist relation under consideration  a relation which necessarily involves a single individual   the capitalist   who has at his disposal more tools than he can  on his own  make full productive use of  His scenarios misleadingly cast the capitalist as someone   indeed  a worker    who is always already in a position to reap the advantages of all of the means of production at his disposition  even  and perhaps  especially before  the worker s  make s  their appearance  Bastiat  1849  p  47   And yet  part of what makes the capitalist  a capitalist   as Proudhon explicitly points out  is precisely the fact that he has at his disposal more tools than he can possibly make full productive use of  Proudhon  1849  p  125   The capitalist is never therefore  someone who experiences privation as a result of lending  he is instead always someone who has more means than he can make use of and is therefore well positioned to lend  Bastiat s use of scenarios that cast the capitalist as one who is deprived  and consequent attempt to evoke within us a sense of moral indignation  is therefore nothing more than a sly trick   one that covers up the very specificity of the capitalist relation   What we are interested in knowing is whether or not  when one has at one s disposition more tools than one can make use of  one may legitimately demand compensation from those who borrow   beyond simple restitution   Bastiat s scenarios  cannot  because of their structural dissimilarity with capitalist relations  provide us any reason to believe so  For what motivates our  yes  to this question after reading Bastiat s scenarios is the  privation  experienced by the worker  and we have shown that the capitalist  by definition  is someone who experiences no privation because he can afford to lend  Proudhon s answer to this question is a resounding  no  and his argument for why this is has much intuitive appeal   If  in lending out the things or means of production at one s disposition  one experiences no privation  and if the act of lending comes at no additional cost  then this act of lending is a service which we might well provide free of charge  provided of course that the person who borrows promises restitution  Proudhon  1849  p  152   Though Proudhon doesn t go so far as to say that we might actually have the  obligation  to lend our capital free of charge when doing so comes at no extra cost to ourselves  my sense is that an argument defending this claim could quite easily be made  Indeed  if one has more than one needs  more than one can productively make use of  it seems quite natural that one should allow others with less to make use of what one has  especially when this comes at no cost to oneself    Works Cited   Bastiat  Frédéric   2015   Capitale et Rente  Dans  Oeuvres complètes de Frédéric

philosophy,2020-05-25 05:44:02,Current Arguments against Determinism  and in Favour of Free Will ,gq2wm8,5,37,To begin with  I d like to say that  for whatever  possibly predetermined   P  reason  I find myself struggling against the idea of determinism and wanting to believe in free will  Yet whenever I think things through  I end up siding with determinism   I ve read some threads on both topics on here  but they often turned into debates about whether or not the term being discussed should be about free will or about control  or some other digression  Or someone used the argument that because something happened  it always had to happen  so that was proof of determinism   end of story  I thought I d start a post here and just get some responses  which I fully plan to interact with  to see what kind of information I might pick up from the knowledgeable community here   To begin with  and you may prefer other terms  but let s try not to argue semantics  if possible   what I mean when I want to discuss determinism versus free will  is not whether or not we are free to do as we want  but whether or not we  have control  to do those things   Whenever I think this through  I always come back to determinism  but I can t tell if my thinking  proves  determinism  or if it falls under the category of some sort of almost circular reasoning fallacy or post hoc fallacy   So when discussing the idea of free will and control  I might start by considering any action  Let s say I m deciding whether to read a book or listen to a record  and I decide to read a book   The determinist argument I d like to deal with posits that I chose to read a book because of all the circumstances in history that lead to that moment  socially  physically  mentally  and so on  Everything is a form of causality leading backward through time   I m only choosing between those 2 things because I bought those items  I only bought them because I encountered the author and artist previously  I liked or was interested in their work because of other work I d seen so that I could fit this work into a framework I had previously developed and that led to my interest  Even further back  the only reason I like reading at all is because my parents read to me when I was younger  and I enjoy records because my grandfather used to play them whenever I visited  The only reason I can afford those items is because I was born into a middle class family  received a university degree  and got a middle class job myself  And on and on   I m sure you know the argument  Everything that came before led me to that moment  every action and thought caused by the prior event  so that when I eventually decided to read that book  it was the only choice I could make   At this point  you often get the assertion that because I chose to read the book  and it was an event in this long chain of causality that led to it  the fact that I  did  make this choice proves that it was the only choice I could make  For some reason  I never see anyone argue against that  And maybe it s correct   To me  though  that seems like an example of using a result in a sample size of one to prove something with 100  certainty  It doesn t work for me    So at that point  I start to think  okay  maybe I still have free will  Maybe the environmental and genetic factors in my history led me to that moment  but that I shouldn t see things so black and white  Maybe I was viewing this too much as either or  as in at that point I chose one option with 100  probability and the other option with 0   Maybe those environmental and genetic factors put me in a position where there was a sliding scale of chance  not 100 0  but maybe 70  likelihood I d choose a record and 30  I d choose a book  maybe that day I had a bit of eye strain from being on the computer at work too much  plus whatever other factors  so the odds were a bit in favour of listening to music   Just because something  did  happen  doesn t meant there was 100  certainty it  would  happen  That feels too much to me like rolling a 6 and then saying there was 100  chance I would roll that  rather than a 1 in 6 chance   But then when we take this further  let s say causality led to a percentage likelihood of one of the choices occurring  70 30 let s say   Fine  but then what leads to the actual decision between them  Well  again  even if there is a set of odds for the choice  there are only 2 options I see that end up resulting in the final choice  chance  and or my conscious being   If chance had something to do with it  that s outside of anything that can really be proven  So I will set this aside for now  but if anyone has anything interesting to add about how it may factor in  I d be interested to hear it  I m not sure if chance playing a roll would lead to determinism or indeterminsm  to be honest   The second option  however  leads me back toward determinism  If I choose between the options and decide to read a book  it seems like I ve chosen against the 70 30 odds I presented in this hypothetical situation earlier  It  feels  as if I ve somehow beaten determinism and make a truly free choice  How refreshing   But  of course  I haven t  because I only make that choice because of a combination of how my brain works  genetics   the knowledge I ve accumulated up to that point  etc etc etc  So  in effect  the very nature of who I am  internally  is the result of the same causality we discussed earlier that led to the  external  circumstances  Sure  I feel as though I built myself into who I am and how I think  but every choice I made along the way was subject to the same causality and determinism that the circumstances around me owning the book and record were   In the end  it seems that the external circumstances around me and that choice  and the internal circumstances of who I am in that moment when I make the choice  are all predetermined   So whatever choice I make is the mathematical conclusion of those things    At this point  the only part of this equation that I can see that might not be deterministic  is chance  And that s not an answer I particularly love either  because who wants to go in search of feeling like they have free will  only to find out that either a  everything is the result of determinism s causality  or b  maybe there s some random chance in there as well  which is just as much out of our control   Yet here we are   So after all of this  I have a few questions  probably in order of my level of interest   1  Does anyone have any arguments against this type of determinism  in favour of free will  or personal control   2  If not  how do you stop yourself from falling into some sort of existential crisis  If none of your choices matter  because you could have never done anything other than what you did  so even acts of kindness mean nothing other than you just following through with what you were always going to do  how do you find peace and or happiness with that  3  Do you think that the action having occurred proves that action was 100  always going to be taken  therein proving determinism  If so  please explain  If not  but you still believe in determinism  what is your argument for it   Finally  I see that questions belong in askphilosophy  but I did develop a position and my questions is just asking for responses to it  which is what I assume is usually the result of a post here  so perhaps that s acceptable   Thanks in advance  I m looking forward to having some engaging discussion

philosophy,2020-05-23 08:54:26,Why I m no longer a realist about the physical world,gozsni,15,51,I m 32  I completed honours in philosophy a decade ago  But just in the last two weeks  I ve been converted to a form of idealism  by a paper written in 1948 that is only now getting some attention because it was published this year by the author s descendants  link below   Here is my version of the argument that has converted me   1   My so called empirical knowledge is knowledge only of sensory information  AKA perception  sensory experiences  ideas  that I am conscious of   2   My belief in a large category of things existing beyond this sensory information  and described by it  is epistemically justified iff that category of things explains the sensory information more reasonably than an explanation that doesn t commit me to the existence of that category of things  in order words  if I m going to postulate things I don t have direct knowledge of they have to earn their keep    3   My knowledge of sensory information  my conscious experiences  is as reasonably explained by Fleming s rule based idealism   4   Therefore  I am not epistemically justified in assuming this sensory information reveals the existence of objects and events in the physical world  there independently of us   5   Therefore  I am only justified in believing in the existence of my experiences ideas   What has changed for me is my inference to the best explanation in 3  I thought my realism about the physical world was earning its keep  What could be more natural  The independent existence of an external world is such an inference of habit and commonsense that it s hard to stand back and actually question it  When I could bring myself to question it fully  I still found it extremely hard to resist for three reasons    Objects appear to me or are available to my experience independently of my will or choice  unlike the recollection of a place  for example    Our sensory experiences are ordered  predictable and able to repeated according to what we call laws of nature   Because things tend to have causes  we should expect there to be objects behind our sensory information causing us to receive it   These observations are so basic and reinforced in our every experience and seem to lead so enviably to realism about the physical world that how could any alternative theory hope to compete  The narrator in Fleming s story offers us such a theory  Each of these three observations instincts he is able to either dispel or reconcile with his form of idealism  which I m calling rule based idealism  Don t accuse me of trying to claim naming rights over it   I just have to call it something  given the author didn t  He was busy writing a quirky story about it    So how does the theory go  The best way I can describe this kind of idealism is  incidentally  the same way I describe my job as a software developer working on role playing PC games  In my line of work  we place an agent in a  soft  world which they can navigate as if it has an existence of its own  And it does have an existence of its own  But only as code  which is essentially a set of rules   If the agent is in condition W  location X and does Y  Z happens and so on   Even a game operating on very simple algorithms can create an illusion comparable on its principles to our waking lives according to this rule based idealism   Which explanation for my sensory information requires the greater ontological commitment  Between the two  I agree with Fleming that the idealism is considerably more parsimonious than physical realism  That means that physical realism needs to be able to offer something pretty useful in return  Reading the paper has left me with no idea what that could possibly be  It now seems fairly clear to me that none of the three observations above actually make the independent existence of a physical world more likely than Fleming s rule based idealism  The character defending this view is less ontologically committed than his interlocutor  champion of commonsense  and yet in no way disadvantaged in making sense of his environment  so to speak   For example  he still wants  and can explain his desire  to turn off his headlights before they drain his car battery even though he denies his car exists as anything more than the sensory experiences he labels  my car    The most significant possible problem with this kind of argument is that it appears to back us into a corner that begins to look like solipsism or scepticism about the external world  including other minds   It risks being marginalised as an extreme or impractical position  Maybe it is a bit extreme in itself  But I view Fleming s rule based idealism as a kind of foundation or starting point from which I can  for example  make allowance for other conscious beings whose conscious experiences interact with my own according to the same rules that govern my own  This is not a commitment to a new kind of stuff   just more  ideas     At the very least  I suggest we owe it to ourselves to seriously question what we gain by our realism about the physical world when we can manage surprisingly well without it  That is what has come as such a shock to me  because the alternatives  Descarte s demon  brains in vats and controlled simulations  have traditionally been so divorced from the reality we re used to  it is novel to come across a theory that makes me feel okay about my illusory physical world  As with the games I develop  the illusion is kind of the point    Here is Fleming s paper  freely accesible  if you re game   p   ,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/gozsni/why_im_no_longer_a_realist_about_the_physical/
philosophy,2020-05-20 03:24:52,Consent  discourse  and deception   Tom Dougherty seems to imply that in order to consent  you must give up your privacy,gn0vjh,1,8,In his paper  No Way Around Consent   Tom Dougherty takes the stance that any sort of lie or lack of disclosure used to gain consent is deception  which should be considered a form of rape    This seems reasonable  if you are having to lie in order to gain consent  then that consent is not gained by informed measures  If you were sold a car on the promise of it working fine  but it turns out the entire engine was missing  it would be reasonable to assume your consent is void as you would have not purchased that car if you had known the truth   He also takes the stance that their are reasonable forms of concealment  For example  using makeup to appear more attractive to potential partners by concealing blemishes of the skin is not considered undue deception   In  Sex  Lies  and Consent    Dougherty  summarizes his arguments by three points   1  Having sex with someone  while lacking their morally valid consent is seriously wrong  2  Deceiving another person into sex involves having sex with that person  while lacking her morally valid consent  3  Therefore  deceiving someone into sex is seriously wrong   One aspect of consent he focuses on   deal breakers   facts or information that  had they been known by a partner  would have caused that partner to not consent to sex  Should you know something or assume to know that something about yourself is a deal breaker to consent  you are morally obligated to disclose that information     Cheating is a common example when discussing concealment and Dougherty s proposals  If a man where to cheat on his wife and then disclose it to her  it is likely she would not want to get sexual with him  Therefore  to not disclose infidelity  a most probable  deal breaker   is to be considered rape by deception  He even confesses that this may seem revisionary to most people s views on consent  but regards that as still a logical conclusion for how we understand consent  Given his proposals  this does not seem to be a reach   But it also seems to put people on the hook for every thought or desire they have  In short  in order to have proper consent  you have to disclose everything about yourself least they be a deal breaker and turn the encounter into rape   For example  if you have a fetish or kink that you know is generally looked down upon  say  being into step sibling roleplay or be a part of the furry fandom  you likely know that these aspects of yourself would be seen as deal breakers by a large many  Therefore  following Dougherty s line of thinking  not disclosing these private fetishes knowing full well they could be deal breakers is rape by deception   despite the fact that these fetishes are things that most people would not reasonably feel comfortable disclosing   This also would likely have to extend to other private thoughts  If a man were to check out his girlfriend s friend and confess to that  his girlfriend who likely not consent to sex that particular night because of his mental infidelity  So to not disclose that would have to be considered not disclosing a deal breaker  But yet again  it is not unreasonable for someone to not want to disclose sexual feelings towards friends or family of their SO  in part to not wanting to hurt their feelings   If a man were to hookup with a rampant supporter of the Purple Party  despite him being a supporter of their ideological opposite  the Bird Party  it would be reasonable of him to assume that his ideology is a  never would I have sex with a member of the Bird Party in a million years  deal breaker and that his disclosure would make his partner terminate the encounter  So his lack of disclosure should also be rape by deception   If you think a person might not have sex with you if they know something about you  and so you withhold that information and have sex with them  that s rape by fraud  If you lied with intent or did not disclose with intent  it s rape      What this effectively concludes is that to have proper consent  you must give up your privacy  From what he is saying  it must be concluded that private thoughts or beliefs are owed property of your partner in order to ensure consent  regardless of if they feel comfortable disclosing that information or not,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/gn0vjh/consent_discourse_and_deception_tom_dougherty/

philosophy,2020-05-17 14:34:49,Hegel  freedom and social structures,gldxet,10,6,As a metaphysician  theorist of the absolute and philosopher of history  Hegel not only aroused suspicion of authoritarianism  but also hated words of many analytical philosophers  The Hegel renaissance of the last 50 years has therefore been accompanied by a reinterpretation of these terms  But now it makes sense  closer to the original  to take Hegel s philosophy seriously as a food for thought and unusual contribution to the discussion   Hegel provides normative resources that many miss in relativistic and post metaphysical approaches  In addition  the study of Hegel sharpens the view that there are not only equal individuals but also a social structure that has power over actors and distributes unequal positions of power to them    This is what thinkers from Marx to Adorno appreciated about Hegel  his awareness that all human interactions are socially pre structured and that social structures can develop a certain life of their own if they are not consciously controlled  Hegel is by no means the apologist of the whole or absolute  but rather its analyst  who assumes that special people and interactions can never be understood without reference to the social whole  In contrast to what has been accepted as Hegel in the analytical space  the concept of the social whole does not primarily refer to a totality of norms and rules  It is also about the physical and infrastructural side of the social and phenomena such as the market  whose market laws do not correspond to market norms such as  fair exchange  and  adherence to the contract     In his social philosophy Hegel asks  What forms of freedom are possible  And soon adds the conditional  when all interactions are socially structured  Hegel s philosophy of law first analyses types of freedom that are important but deficient because they do not take enough account of social conditionality  namely atomistic and arbitrary consumer decisions and individual freedom of action  And he concludes that the highest degree of freedom is only possible through collective reflection on and intervention in social structures  He formulates this insight particularly with regard to the market  which must be  tamed like a wild animal  by a meeting of the estates in which professional groups coordinate their interests   This conclusion escapes former non metaphysical Hegelians like Pippin and Pinkard  They do not follow Hegel s central step from a theory of action to a social structural analysis  but only look for social conditions of the actors  Hegel s conclusion is only consistent for a thinker who places the absolute or the whole in the foreground of his thinking in his entire system  from logic and natural philosophy to aesthetics    For Hegel  individuals  people  events  animals  determinations  are centrally determined by their position in the structured group or system to which they belong  There may be cases in which this social determination  with the role and identity desired by the individual  falls into one  Hegel optimistically assumes this for the family  But it is clear that a tension can also arise between social role or position and individual self  In such cases  the self reflection and identity that people have developed in these and other circles does not match their social role and position of power   The only solution to this problem is for people to reflect together on the structures of their interaction and negotiate such rules and roles that are as fair to all as possible   At the latest here  Marx separates from Hegel  and non Marxists will also have their justified doubts that finding an optimal social structure for all social groups or such a negotiation and intervention is practicable   But this does not mean that Hegel s philosophy is irrelevant  250 years after his birth  the metaphysical Hegel reminds us that not everything is made up of norms and meanings that change as soon as we change our minds and to which we are only bound if they convince us  Social structures have real power and a certain resistance to our collective views that goes beyond simple habit  And he stresses that social patterns and structures are not as confusing as one might think  There are clear mechanisms that can and should be analysed  criticized and morally judged  In abstracto  Hegel s metaphysics analyses types of structures and their problematic  sometimes even  violent  modes of operation  This helps him to better analyze social structures and thus to judge them   For the metaphysical Hegel the postulate of freedom and equality of all people is quite important as a legal principle and basis of private and public law  But it can by no means solve the problem of human freedom alone  In order to understand the problem of freedom properly  one must admit that social structures exist and therefore structural inequalities  unequal degrees of freedom  participation and material advantages  which are neither chosen by individuals nor are they inherent  In addition to the principles of justice  it is this structure that makes a society more just or less just  depending on whether it maximizes the freedom and social participation of many or few   A central criterion for assessing a society is therefore  according to Hegel  the breadth and depth of social co determination  in the sense that as many social groups as possible can defend their real interests as concretely as possible  and thus participate in the material and other advantages of their society  A comparative study of Rawls would be interesting here  especially with regard to his concept of predistribution  an institution of society that fights social inequality ex ante rather than ex post,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/gldxet/hegel_freedom_and_social_structures/

rant,2020-08-24 21:48:01,i wrote this thing for school a few years ago its sort of a rant,ifv3k5,1,0,Do Video games Cause Violence  The media and many others say  yes but Have they done the research to back this claim up  Many People Including The president and The older generations will tell you that Violent video games make you a violent person or something along those lines  But I Disagree with this And have the information to back Myself up  Unlike Many people who say that they cause violence  I m not saying that Video games don t cause violence among to say younger kids  9 and below  or people with pre existing conditions  I do agree that these types of people may be affected by Games like DOOM or COD  Ect  I do believe that in people with no condition and who are not too young they do not change anything in a person and may do the opposite and help the person with teamwork  Patience  Hand eye coordination  and many other skills as well   The dispute of  do Video games Cause violence has been an ongoing Argument between Gamers and the Media  in which as a gamer I will admit we have been at each other throats on the topic  with the media making News articles and the  gamers  making an endless stream of Memes to go along with them  but who is in the correct in this argument    according to a policy statement from the Media Psychology Division of the American Psychological association scant evidence has emerged  that makes any casual cause or Correlation Connection between playing violent games and actually committing violent acts  According to a  New York Times article by Kevin Draper   This tells us that there is no correlation between violent acts and Video games  In a study by VOX show  the number of Video games sold compared to the crime rates of Different countries and what it found was that America has the most Gun violence and some of the most games sold but not the most  which Japan had they also had one of the lowest gun violence rates in the world  which shows that Video games have only a slight impact on violence  These are some of the Arguments that have been ongoing between our 2 groups in which The Gamers have been in the right so far   The president and many others have blamed video games for school shootings across America instead of the real problem which is the people and how easy it is for a mentally unstable person to buy a gun and ammo for it   If video games did indeed cause some mass shootings  one might expect such events to be common in Japan or South Korea  Both countries spend more per capita on video games than the United States  according to  Newzoo   and have huge video game communities  Japan is home to video game makers like Nintendo  Sega  and Sony  while South Korea has a highly developed competitive video gaming industry   But Japan and South Korea   both of which have very strict laws limiting gun ownership   have among the lowest rates of crime in the world  and mass casualty events are quite rare  This is from an article by the new york times   This tells us that the problem isn t the games it s the Ease of getting a gun in our country and the number of people who hate people who are any different shows a problem with America as a whole with the lack of Descimination Programs for children and just  in general  a lack of education about other peoples  In a chart showing the amount of violence that year and the number of games sold it showed that In 1998 we had the lowest amount of games sold but the highest Violent crime rates  I also showed that game sales increased each year and Violent crime rates went down every year except for a few minor spikes  This again shows that if anything was affected it was the opposite and video games actually lowered crime which I doubt but they certainly didn t increase it  So no the more games people play Doesn t have any impact on their overall personality  maybe a slight personality change but not for the worse    Some may say that some school shooters have played video games which is one Main thing many have pointed out  But that s like saying Just because the school shooter walks he became violent and mentally ile which is completely untrue since 65  of young adults are gamers when the real problem is the stress at home and putting on kids and the expectations they feel have been set for them this combined with other things and it can ruin someone s mental state   Do video games cause violence  No  in this article I have given evidence that states no video games do not cause violence or Make you More Violent and the real problem is the people themselves  I know many people will still say that Video games cause violence but if they did a quick google search they would know instantly that they are completely wrong and if you still don t believe me then whatever go on and believe what you want it doesn t affect any of us we will just keep doing what we enjoy and you can t stop us from doing what makes us happy   Just a side note I have nothing against guns  in fact  I like guns and know a bit about them I just think some extra measures of security would be good  to everyone who thinks I am trying to take their guns away  That s not at all what i m saying      TLDR   gaming doesnt teach you how to pew

rant,2020-08-24 17:28:08,A  god  that is limitless    omniscient  omnipotent  omnipresent and so on    would just as well make every single belief right ,ifq0lk,1,1,An excerpt from a book called  Servant of Darkness Master of Light  on Amazon which is part of the free sample that s available there                                                                                 There is a fad around saying we can t understand god  This comes from individuals conditioned on diminishing themselves  Those who do not want to accept what existence is in its entirety  or see what creation is showing us every single day  First of all  whenever I use the word  god  from now on  I only mean to refer to a generic source  You may understand the word  god  as whatever is most comfortable  for it won t matter or change what comes next  Also  while many religions may have more gods  when they do  these gods are more partial with each one having less functions than the total  So when I say  god   I mean what represents the total    or the fusion and sum of all gods in polytheistic contexts  I d say a very convenient interpretation of the word  god  in the book is one that sees god just as a source  The source of everything that exists   Life is too much of a mystery and the reasons for that are mainly ignorance and selfishness  There are lots of unanswered questions flying around regarding our origins  destiny and the meaning of life  Knowledge from ancient texts that could help has been badly translated  incorrectly interpreted  and at times scattered  destroyed  hidden  or just lost  Luckily  one of the basic characteristics of god is that god is everywhere  What is everywhere is also in our minds and bodies  We literally have god in our hands  If we didn t  or if we weren t to understand more  then god would not be omnipresent  This certainly allows us find answers  God being the source from which all creation comes forth means that all explanations about creation also come forth from god  So  in practice and by logic  god is telling us everything all the time  But first  since we are talking about finding answers and understanding god  we must also define the truth   The truth must be complete and include all possibilities  thus having no exceptions  When we learn something true it is unquestionable  not because of authority  but because it is simply impossible to question truth    unless the question itself is not logical  If you can use logic to question something  it is either a lie or at best an imperfect partial truth  because it left room for sensible questioning  Also  the truth is always simple and powerful  Lies are the ones which are complex  Lies need constant reinforcement to be believed in  Lies are what need authority  effort and repetition to brainwash everyone  The truth does not  In fact  the word  truth  is a synonym for the word  god   since both must be perfect    the reason why it is said  god is the truth   Knowing how to recognize the truth  we may start decoding the rules of existence by simple logic  Since the truth must always make sense  god also must make sense  Logic is our best tool to find the truth  logic is the best way to understand god   Despite the fact many religions exist  the basic premises for the source of everything don t change much  One of these premises is that the source is perfect  having unlimited qualities    omnipotence and omniscience  Our first problem  therefore  lies in saying that god is  good   or that god is  love   or that god is anything too specific for that matter  Being perfect requires perfect balance  and perfect balance is only possible by containing everything  so all counterparts balance themselves  Not good or bad  but both  not love or hate  but both  not peace or conflict  but both  and so on  especially considering when a religion is polytheistic these more specific gods always have their opposites  Since god is even both female and male  I shall refer to god with the  it  pronoun   The source is both dark and light  both water and fire  both earth and air  both death and life  both angels and demons    It would be illogical to say there s anything in creation that did not come from the creator    even ideas  And since all springs from god  this already allows us to conclude that god is neutral  The truth can never choose sides  because it must be exactly what explains absolutely everything  The truth is neutral  As such  everything has a reason to exist  because the total  or god  is always in perfect balance  Therefore  even though everything has a consequence  nothing in creation is  right  or  wrong   for  right and wrong  in most cases are just human judgments and something inherently wrong would simply not exist  We can speak of  right  or  wrong  though in terms of self development  because for those who want to seek any sort of ascension  be it worldly or otherwise  straying from balance is wrong and means distancing oneself from equilibrium  or distancing oneself from the source  Keeping oneself closer to balance naturally requires a balanced path  which we will discuss in many other parts of this book   Now  since the source can only be perfection itself  if we think of something that has reached a state of infinite qualities  we conclude it has no mission anymore  Absolute cognition means having nothing more to learn  Absolute might means having nothing more to practice  Being everywhere means having no new space or time to visit  and considering god is everything  it also is space itself and time itself  meaning that changes in space or time don t even exist at god level  Being everywhere entails being in every possible coordinate of space and time  In a lesser scale  imagine yourself in relation to your home  If you were everywhere  you wouldn t even be able to move inside the house    unless you were to assume a lesser form and pretend you were not omnipresent for some time   Having space and time to move in or even references as  here and there   or  past and future  are mechanisms to be perceived by our imperfect forms that need to navigate existence  At god level there is only  here and now     or in simpler terms  space and time are just ways to make creation function  because for god everything that s ever happened or will ever happen exists  here and now   Both life and death are naturally mechanisms for said navigation of existence too  and can only be just as neutral  since both have positive and negative aspects and carry their shares of pleasure or suffering depending on how they re dealt with   We  in our imperfect forms  can only say we exist while we have a mission  while we have goals to achieve  I know what I know because there s more that I don t  I do what I can because there s more that I can t  There is desire in our imperfection  When I look out to the world  I know what I am based on everything that I am not  If I reach a point where I am everything  then I am also nothing    knowing everything and being capable of everything is ultimately knowing nothing and doing nothing at the same time  Perfection is a dual state of both existence and non existence  The reason why god is the alpha and the omega is thus revealed  which obviously means saying both the alpha and the omega are the same thing  This is exactly the requirement for an infinite loop  Infinity only makes sense when the beginning and the end are the same  as such  creating a loop  accomplishing infinity and making god be the beginning and end of even itself too  God is both the highest and the lowest points of existence  everything and nothing  both the starting and final stages of a game of infinity   I find it important to add now  that this is naturally not about answering the question whether god exists with either yes or no  To understand this  one must throw away all binary views inside existence  because the source is a concept out of existence  or what generates existence  This question can only be answered with both yes and no  especially because the truth can t have any exceptions  so the truth  in fact  can only be the total collective of every possibility  One could even imagine a greater being laughing at all of humanity saying that everyone is right about god  The ones who say it is merciful  the ones who say it is cruel  the ones who say it exists and even the ones who say it does not exist    since god is both everything and nothing at the same time  Nothing stops even a mix of all heavens  all hells and all other planes being real  with everyone going to where they deserve    which  of course  would involve mechanisms far more complex than what people believe     only to spend more time in another incomplete view of the whole system   What better solution than that  People delusionally wishing to impose limits on a limitless concept    limits which are convenient for them    and ignorantly fighting over who is right  while god provides both the ultimate justice and the ultimate joke making everyone right  All with incomplete  but true views    Atheism is right  Islam is right  Judaism is right  Taoism is right  Buddhism is right  Christianity is right  Hinduism is right  Sikhism is right  Jainism is right  all ethnic religions and mythologies are right  Mexican  African  Greek  Norse  Roman  Celtic  Japanese  Chinese    and so on  Logically  god being everything also includes being both  the paladin  and  the trickster  at the same time  distributing all sorts of salvation and punishment that the whole system should require to stay in balance  and if you think something that s limitless can t do that  you re again falling into the trap of trying to limit god   One could argue then  out of misery  that god has a limit and is not everything  If god had a limit  then not even the sciences would have many questions that can only be answered with infinity  Also  while limits may at times be hard to break  they can always be expanded  even the whole universe is currently in constant expansion  Last  but not least  if one chooses to believe in a  limited god   then by logic something else is going to be the absolute god  and the reasoning stays just the same about the absolute source   More importantly  even though this answer might not be perfect  my goal here is to provide something better than what we have  And what we have right now is tons of sectarian and limited views that also limit people  The greatest martial artists become such by knowing at least the basics of every martial art they can  The greatest doctors become such by knowing at least the basics of every system of medicine they can  The greatest beings will only become such by knowing at least the basics about absolutely everything that they can  Striving for greatness will be discussed especially on the last chapter  My point  for now  is that even though it is possible to strive for excellence while belonging to any belief system  most people who belong to a specific belief system end up being satisfied with mediocre answers about everything and being slaves to partial views  God being neutral means that believing or not doesn t even matter  as long as you do not believe something limited and partial  Just as absolutely everything in space and time for god is just here and now we should try to always focus on living in the present doing what we can do here and now  which is expand our own limits in every aspect possible

rant,2020-08-23 19:07:30,I initially made this as a comment on another post but wanted to share it here ,if5s4u,22,6,Regarding the  All cops are bastards because they work for a corrupt system  Ya know it s weird  Almost like leaving their job would mean they wouldn t have an income  It s almost like most people can t afford to you and quit because their place of work is corrupt because they have bills to pay and a family or maybe just themselves to take care of  In the middle of a pandemic no less  It s funny  really  There are corrupt systems everywhere  especially in large businesses outsourced to third world countries to use their labors for our benefit  People die all the time because of that system  But where is the riots and raging for them  hmm  Okay  so maybe it s the power you re upset about  the authority  yes  Well what about teachers  now very very few people die at the hands of teachers  duh  But hundreds of children are raped by female teachers and given little more than a slap on the wrist  Where are the riots for them  huh  Are all female teachers rapists  No  Is everyone that works for nestle classist  No  Then why are all cops bastards  Hmm   Now I do agree that the police brutality margin is insane  I do  but what I don t agree with the the contradictions that Acab pushes  We want more training and more less than lethal options  Now  pushing aside the fact that less than lethal s don t always work and that many a shootings on criminals is because it s a case of  if I don t shoot  will they shot me or my partner  that s still a wonderful idea  However  what do these things cost     Money  And yet you want to defund the police  It s blatantly stupid  And unfortunately I don t believe that any amount of chaos and riots and even if it comes to it  war will solve the problem  Not even an entire system reform  Why  Because there are bad people out there  People who will continue to be racist and abuse people wether or not under that system  That doesn t make it okay  but it also doesn t make it okay to put every individual under that umbrella  being a cop  in that category  Just how we shouldn t say all men are rapists  all women are Karen s  all blacks are violent  all whites are racists  all Germans are nazis etc    In conclusion  I disagree  and for reference if anyone decides to turn this into a conservatives are bad or liberals are bad debate  At least get my position in that right instead of calling me a conservative boot licker   I m a left leaning centrist  Thank you,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/if5s4u/i_initially_made_this_as_a_comment_on_another/
rant,2020-08-24 11:37:07,Found out how truly horrific my family is   ,ifl90r,1,0,So for context   1  My father is a Narcissist   2  My father is abusive  controlling and very violent   3  We are a  perfect family  purely for his image  and if you deviate even slightly from the  script     may the Lord have mercy on your soul   4  When I was 12 I asked the family lawyer if I could  divorce  my dad because of his constant abuse   5  Mother is preparing paperwork to file for divorce now   6  I m 24 and still stuck in this hellhole   Now let s start from the top   My father has always been absent and replaces affection with money  he doesn t praise or communicate  just throws money at me when I open my mouth  He has always being violent and angry and me  reserved and avoiding conflict   Flashback to when I was 18  engaged and very happy  we knew each other a long time before getting engaged  and I was very isolated  so please don t judge based on my age   My fiancee ended up being very abusive and would beat me to within an inch of my life  When it got too bad  I tried to get out  In the same time as these developments  my father beat my mother for the first time  called me and told me she tried to kill herself  He left town  called me and told me to deal with it   When I got to the farm  she was just sitting on some flour sacks in the storage room with the head farmhand holding her hands  He told me everything that happened   I snapped  loaded them both into the car and headed for the hospital  The hospital gave my mum some pain meds and sent us to the police to report the case  Upon getting to the police station  we try to file a case   My mother couldn t speak properly for 3 months after so I had to do the talking   The police chief calls my father and asks his view on events and he tells the Chief not to believe a word we say since we are both  on hardcore drugs  apparently  The chief put the phone down and asked if we had taken any medications in the past 24 hours  I told him yes  my mother was just given pain medication  He told us that druggies cannot report crimes and to please leave his police station as the  drugs  make my mothers statement unusable   The hospital gave these meds so yeah    uhm OK     Please note that at this point I was PISSED  and I hardly got angry in that time of my life    So we moved in with my fiancee  Where he proceeded to abuse me even more  I then broke up with my fiancee because I had this newfound anger and would fight back when he hit me  leaving scratches and bruises that showed signs of self defense   Ironic that I could stand up for my mother and want to report it but could never do it for myself   Basically  he violated me and forced himself on me several times and I was just too afraid to tell anyone  he was my fiancee after all    My father threatened us with court and forced us back into his  custody   We moved back to the city and left everything else behind  We got locked up in our flat every day for a year until my one old school friend got a job and needed extra help  I started working and getting out of the house  and because I had a job  my father couldn t lock us up anymore because I had to keep up appearances    He tried to hit me once  I blacked out from anger and came to  with my father looking scared of me and backed up against the wall  He has never even lifted a hand near me again   Mom says I get this  face  when the anger switch flips  that face has saved me from many scary situations that could have gone sideways FAST    Everything got better  I started studying and got my mother to join me  so that she too could get out of the house  We have both finished our masters and can t find jobs in the midst of this Corona    My father is gradually getting more violent and will throw things  scream constantly and start raising hands  The stress and panic and anxiety is so bad we both have stomach ulcers and get a lot of panic attacks  My mother has started losing it  but I told her to just divorce him so we can get out  She is organising the paperwork currently  finally    My father is constantly complaining about how expensive I am and I spend too much money  my own money  etc  But I earn less than minimum and can t even afford my own 1 bedroom apartment  even with a frigging degree  When I finally found one at 22  this was two years ago  that I could afford  I paid the deposit and started packing  When he found out he called the owner of the apartment and withdrew my deposit  saying that I would not be moving in    Imagine my surprise when he kept the money and told me that if I ever leave  he will find me  Now 2 years later  I have been saving as much as I can and am packing  I will be immigrating and he doesn t know a thing about this  I refuse to tell him because I KNOW he will try to stop me with all his  connections   or just end up sueing me for something he made up   Another last thing  my father is very  rich  but is millions in debt  he loans money to family friends in exchange for sexual favors  Also not to count the 34 girlfriends I have met know of in the past 3 years   Mom and dad are separated  but not legally    yet   I honestly just feel like I never want kids  to get married or nothing  I just want to be me  with my dog  somewhere far away from toxic people like my father and ex fiancee  In the middle of nowhere  where nobody can hurt me anymore  and if they try  I am ready for them  I have trained my brain and body in order to protect myself and it is now my first and only instinct   This is not how I want to live my life  in fear  horror or suspicion of normal people who are not like those monsters   Sorry for the whole darn life story but I just needed to write it somewhere    and hopefully someone else gets where I am coming from  I know I am not alone in this   TL DR People are jerks and I am angry about it  wanting to live in isolation before I kick said jerk s butts,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/ifl90r/found_out_how_truly_horrific_my_family_is/

rant,2020-08-23 21:52:04,I m really tired of people  specifically Redditors  of blaming Americans when corrupt establishment politicians are elected,if8tby,5,5,The same people who go  durr America is a 3rd world country  look at how much voter suppression there is  also go  Muricans stupid for electing Blumpf  they deserve him as President   How the fuck do these idiots not see the inherent contradiction  The reasons for politicians getting elected in America  and in basically almost every country  is more complicated than just people voting for them    First  voter suppression is a huge problem in the US  The process of voting in America is incredibly  and most likely intentionally made to be  tedious and unorganized  People have to take time out of their busy workdays to wait in long  slow lines just to exercise their basic human right to vote  This is a likely contributor to the disparity in generations who vote  Baby boomers don t have to work long jobs just to make ends meet like Millennials and Generation Z do  so boomers have more time on their hands to vote   Second  the political establishment and institutions in the US are incredibly biased towards wealthy establishment interests  If a progressive candidate actually manages to jump through incredibly difficult hurdles and get somewhat successful in winning elections  they ll eventually get pushed out  This is because US political institutions are built to favor which candidate has the most wealth and resources  Candidates who favor establishment and elite interests will get the most corporate and wealthy class support  thus giving them an advantage over progressive or working class politicians who do not have the support of PACs or corporate interests  Both the major political parties  Democrats and Republicans  have huge amounts of institutional power that is heavily backed by corporate money    Because of this  both parties are structurally biased against any politician who will fight for worker s rights  This makes it near impossible for a politician who will actually help everyday people win  Bernie Sanders being relatively successful in the 2020 primaries was an actual miracle and an incredibly unprecedented moment in US history  The fact that he got that far as a politican who truly supported worker s rights is a sign of growing unrest among Americans about the current system  but his grassroots support could not take the incredibly powerful and organized Democratic establishment    Also because of this  Joe Biden and Donald Trump being the only two choices we have is not Americans  fault  Like I said  both political parties are structurally biased towards establishment candidates  An inherently corrupt and classist political establishment is what got Biden and Trump  not American voters    And lastly  the electoral college  I m sure everyone knows how broken and elitist the electoral college is  but people still blame Americans for voting in Trump despite the fact that the electoral college and all of the shit I listed above is what got him elected  The electoral college is literally a system that has the power to ignore what the majority of Americans want  and people still blame Americans for electing shitty Presidents    But no  let s ignore all of what we wrote and just call Americans stupid  What the fuck does that even accomplish  If you want to fix our socioeconomic and sociopolitical problems  how is insulting everyone s intelligence going to accomplish that  It does nothing but give the pretentious morons who say this a small amount of superiority over people  I swear to fucking god  we live in a global society filled with people who are desperate to feel superior to other people  no matter how fucking petty the particular issue is  This is especially apparent in the fucking Imperial vs Metric system Reddit debates   IT S FUCKING MEASUREMENTS  WHO FUCKING CARES  YOU RE NOT BETTER THAN OTHER PEOPLE BECAUSE YOU USE CENTIMETERS  GET A HOBBY AND FIND SOME OTHER WAY TO BOOST YOUR FRAGILE SELF ESTEEM  FFS,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/if8tby/im_really_tired_of_people_specifically_redditors/

rant,2020-08-22 19:49:02,I was born blind  Nobody wrote this for me ,ielums,136,23,Many people seem to think that the evolution of mainstream technology is on a growing list of reasons why we  blind people  can t function in the world without the help of a sighted person  This is really far from the truth  I use my flat  touch screen iPhone every day with the screen totally blacked out  I can explore the screen  hear the names of the things I m touching  and double tap them to actually choose them  I sit down at my desk and instantly have access to Windows and Mac computers which I ve connected to a mixer and a keyboard switcher so I can control them both at once   The category of software that makes this possible is called a screen reader   NVDA   is probably the one I use the most on Windows  it s free and open source  But every mainstream operating system comes with one built in now  probably in settings under accessibility or something similar  and most of them are really good  They all provide extra touch screen gestures to navigate without being able to see precisely where everything is  and they have lots of extra keyboard commands to quickly search through apps and websites  Even my Samsung TV  Apple TV and Fire cube all have screen reading software that reads the current item as I move around  They aren t magic  they can t figure out what s in a picture for instance  and some web designers and programmers make mistakes that take away my access even though it functions just fine for a sighted user  However  anyone reading this should know that a large portion of Reddit is highly text based and that s one of the many reasons I enjoy being a user here  Besides that  AI is evolving to a level that allows a computer to recognize objects in photos  and any  OCR   app will pull the text out of pictures  which is slightly clunky but doable   Can you imagine being a person who physically could not use the internet or the features of a modern Smartphone  but also couldn t read print  It was fine when I was a kid and didn t really care  I had Braille and audio books galore because my mom is awesome  and nobody really had the internet  But now  everyone has some kind of computer or phone and the whole world is digital  and I m an adult who needs to be able to get through the digital world  I ve been to college  including partially online classes and a ton of computer based homework   and currently do a fairly specialized technical job  I ve lived completely alone for the past 8 years and have continued to do so this year when it would have been unwise to ask anyone for help  Blind people managed without tech  but it didn t take long for people to work out ways of making computers talk  and Apple believed in the accessibility of their devices far more than most blind people did  adding their first mobile version of the VoiceOver screen reader to iOS 3 0  Now  my phone has apps on it to help me read print  look up barcodes  get specialized walking and transit directions  and get immediate professional video help if I need to make sure clothing matches or something  I take advantage of services like Uber  Doordash and Instacart so I can travel and shop relatively independently   The bottom line is that there are a ton of us reading and commenting on posts here  and using the internet in general  And honestly  we re nothing special  We re just people who operate under the limitations we re given  There are sometimes more limitations  but there are also a lot of ways to work around them  and we work together to discover and invent these solutions   It s really common to search for posts about blind people and come up with some Ask Reddit thread asking how blind people do x  y  or z  I love these questions  I actually take the time to answer a lot of them when I get the chance  But it s pretty clear the original poster often doesn t expect an actual blind person to answer  although I m seeing a lot more  Blind People of Reddit     posts recently  so that s encouraging  But still  this assumption is so pervasive that they have helpfully added a sticky to the top of every such post that talks about how blind people use computers and mentions that  ableism   is not tolerated  Despite the sticky  there is always at least one misinformed person somewhere in the comments  I saw an AMA from someone in my Twitter network earlier this month  and the number of  Who is reading this to you  questions was unreal   Honestly  I think the issue goes beyond the assumption that we re shut out of tech  To me  this is a small piece of something larger I experience all the time  the automatic assumption that since a particular task is usually done visually  I can t do it  There s no room for maybes and no willingness to do research  When someone does ask a question knowing we can answer  there s always that one wannabe clown who makes a joke about blind people not being able to read the post in the first place  When someone does an AMA and actually notes that blind people can use computers  people still don t read it all the way and just assume someone is writing and reading Reddit for her  because somehow it s easier to think a sighted helper is the solution to her technology use than it is to imagine that technology  is  the solution  And honestly  I think if the consequences of these assumptions didn t affect me at all  I would laugh  Sometimes I do anyway  because it s just sheer stupidity  But the fact so many people are able to see a post that asks blind people questions and automatically think  Wow  that s stupid  no blind person is going to read this   or see an AMA and think  Wow  who s reading these comments and typing the answers   rather than  Hey wait a minute  technology is awesome right  So maybe there s a way blind people can use Reddit and I don t know about it  Why don t I google that or ask in a comment   speaks volumes about how content a large portion of society is with the belief that we re simply shut out of something everyone else takes for granted  And it s one thing to have our capabilities questioned by Redditors  but some of those Redditors are also employers who need to decide whether to hire us  programmers who need to follow standards to make their software accessible to us  or customer service people who just need to stop asking my mom or my Uber driver questions about me as though I can t hear them   Seriously  why do people do this    I honestly believe that in general  people are open minded and interested in learning  but the biggest uphill battle for myself and so many others is just getting people to stop assuming we re incapable  and start trusting that we know our own limits enough to stop considering us a liability  And don t get me wrong  there are people who don t actually have the skills or experience to do something as well as they think they do  and like any minority  they ll turn around and call someone ableist for pointing out what is obvious  Maybe I ve been one of those people at some point in my life  It s easy to feel like the entire world forces us to prove ourselves time and again in a thousand small ways  It s easy to hold onto something as small as the time you told a stranger you knew where you were going four times and they still walked behind you and told you when to turn left  robbing you of the ability to prove you did in fact know where you were going   I won t be one of those people  and I sincerely hope this post doesn t unnecessarily shame anyone  I just want people to think that maybe there s another way to accomplish something  and maybe we can actually do that thing you thought we couldn t do  I will also say that for everyone who assumes  there are always ten more people who are really interested and will ask lots of insightful questions which actually make me stop and consider the answer  and a hundred who stay silent because they know I can  I appreciate all of those people  My inbox is open  people do AMAs all the time  and there is also a blind subreddit is where you can find most blind people of Reddit as well as answers to a lot of frequently asked questions   Thanks so much for reading this far,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/ielums/i_was_born_blind_nobody_wrote_this_for_me/

rant,2020-08-23 16:26:19,My mother made my family hate me,if35iq,2,2,I am so tired and angry I really need to rant right now    My mother is not a good mother  she is very much toxic  she used to drink so much everyday and was never here for me and my siblings  my eldest brother that we will call Bernard used to beat the shit out of my other big brother that we will call André  I was never hit by Bernard but I still grew up in thr terror of being hit  I had my first sexual relation when I was so young by a family member and it lasted till I understand what was happening to me and made ut stop  I feel so dirty because of that and can t stand my own body and it all happened because my mother though she was such a perfect woman and that we were all happy    I used to think that woman was a godess  she told us she did everything for us  and I trusted her  I though she was the best woman on earth  she told me my dad was never here for me of my brothers so I though she was right and I asked him why he never payed for anything  I didn t wanted to go to his house  and one day I realised that she was manipulative  and everything started to fell appart for me    I started to realise she had a drinking problem  one time I asked her if she wanted a drink   tu veux à boire     I was thinking about water  and she got really angry at me telling me she was no alcoholic    I decided to go more and more at my dad place and get to know him  he was really happy  but every time I was at her place she started an argument  getting yelled at everyday because I dared to have a good time at my dad place  because I should hate it here    It was so tiring  I was in my worst place at that moment  depression  suicidal thoughts  I hurted myself in a regular basis  and with all her yelling it didn t helped me at all   On day I told her I was not okay  and she told me I didn t know what was depression  that I didn t have the right to says that  I didn t even said I had depression because I wasn t diagnosed     It hurt me so much  but you know what  I said nothing  I comforted her  every time I got yelled at for nothing I said nothing  because I was afraid of her  I just let her verbally abuse me almost every day My favorite time was school because I was in boarding school  I hate school  it was stressful and the girls in my room could have been better  but I still preferred to be here than at her place    This years I was an Aupair  one full years away from everyone  and I was happy  for the first time in my life I was not stressed  I started to work on my trauma  I was so happy    But my contract finished and I come back last saturday  I didn t wanted to see her   But I was afraid of her yelling at me  so tuesday at 18 00 I was at her place  she looked normal as usual  she asked for hugs  I don t like hugs and it s worse from her  I let her do it because I was afraid of her reaction  I had a friend with me that didn t wanted me to be alone   The next day  she goes off on me  for no reason again I wad playing a game with my friend and my sister and suddenly I am a little bitch and it s my fault my grandma  her mother  is dying  I saw her she look very much alive and anyway she is 93    She stressed my friend so much that she started to cry once my mother was not her anymore  she come back to her home soon after   The next day was the day I saw my therapist who know my mother  since a year she told me my mother was toxic and I needed to get away from her  she was still on her word   In the afternoon I was watching a cartoon on the TV in english with english subtitle  my mother got pissed of at me because I am horrible to do that to my sister  who wasn t watching the TV  and I could at least put it in french  the french dub is not my cup of tea and anyway the translation make a lost to the original   My grandma  dad side  call  she take my phone to talk to her  and my little sister  10  ask who it is  our mother told her it was grandma  my sister says hello  but like  we don t have the same father  I told her it s not her grandma because I was thinking she though it wad hers   After the call my mother goes off on me because it was cruel and disgusting of me to have said that  I says sorry    Anyway my mother still decide to yell  I am afraid I go in my sister room  I don t have my own room anymore  and start to pack a bag to pass the night at my friend place because I am scared and sad and upset to be yelled at again  I realise my phone charger is outside the room and ask my sister to get it  She come back hand empty with my mother behind her  seeming very angry and yelling at if she was afraid of her   t as peur de moi maintenant      My sister cry and tell her yes  that she always scream at me  that she made my friend cry the day before   And now you have to understand  my mother is the queen of acting like a victim  like she never done something wrong  like everyone is bad to her  and she is really gopd at guilt trip people  She start to cry    And I know where it s going  I can already heard her saying how could my sister  my ten years old baby sister can say something so hurtful    I can get yelled at  she can say I am a bitch  I am egoist  I am a whore or anything else  she can says that  but trying to guilt trip at 10 years old    I couldn t   And yes I did an error  I screamed back at her  I screamed she didn t have the right to cry   We screamed back and forth to each other  my bag is already packed  I was scared she hit me  I ran away to my friend for the night  I didn t insulted her so  I yelled at her to leave us alone mostly    The next day I come back  my bags are packed  she told me my dad come to me    And I learned she told everyone I hit her    I receive a horrible message from Bernard but explained the truth to André  he trust so it s okay  my sister looked at me right in the eyes and told me she hate me    My mother family is sending so much text I don t have the force to read  my mother send me 5 text that I didn t open because it started by  Tu n imagine pas le mal que tu nous as tous fait  so basically that I hurt them all    My dad s girlfriend don t like me and want me out of the house as soon as possible  I had a shitty pay and obly have like 300  with me and Bernard want to destroy all my stuff  I am 18  I don t have money nor a home and I am so lost  I

involved in the different communities  and after about a year of being on this site  I feel like expressing my thoughts      and ranting a bit    Now  I don t hate Reddit  Actually  I really like a lot of the aspects of this website  I ve seen lots of positivity in many different communities  and have actually gotten some great advice on very serious matters  There are some truly great people on this website           but like every mainstream website  Reddit isn t immune to the more  toxic side of the internet  The toxicity on this site can spread from any community  whether it be a gaming subreddit  or a political subreddit  There are a lot of people on this site who think they re way smarter than they really are  and act like complete assholes because of it   I m not saying I m perfect  and that I haven t said some stupid things when online  But some people on this website really take it to the next level  It honestly takes the fun out of conversation  because what s the point in talking with a pretentious jerk   Anyway  here s the good  and the bad of my experience on Reddit         The Good    Like I said  this website has allowed me talk about a massive variety of different topics  and has allowed me to have some great discussions    I ve found so many different communities  each of which giving me an opportunity to talk about things that interest me  and the chance to get advice on some very important issues    For example  the different writing and worldbuilding subreddits are filled with really kind  casual people  You can ask for advice  or just casually talk about a certain idea you ve had  and from my experience  I ve always met a really positive group of people on these subreddits  Same goes for the artistic subreddits  Overall  this site has given me the chance to be creative  and share the creativity with some really nice people   I ve mentioned this a few times now  but this site has also given me the chance to talk about some very serious issues in my life  and I have gotten some great advice from some really kind people  I don t even know who s on the other side of the screen  but whoever is there  they ve devoted their time to help me  someone they don t even know  I ve gotten advice and insight on mental health  and life plans  and so on  I definitely wish I could thank the people on this site  who ve taken the time to talk to me when I needed it         The Bad    Now let me clarify  I believe that for the most part  Reddit is a website with a positive community  I d like to believe the toxicity of this sight is only relegated to certain areas  and isn t that widespread  Of course  I m not entirely sure   The mors toxic and shitty side of this website isn t just limited to a few communities  There are assholes everywhere  whether it be a media based subreddit  or a world news based subreddit  So yeah  some of these problems aren t that big of a deal  Like  some guy on the Playstation subreddit might be an asshole  but it isn t gonna ruin my day or anything  Still  it s annoying how even a casual conversation can turn to shit because of a few assholes   Here s a quick example  I made a post on how I think the new Avengers game is really good  I made sort of a mini review  and expected some interesting conversation  Instead  70  of the people commenting didn t actually care about any real conversation  and just wanted to yell about how I enjoy a game they didn t  or how I used their favorite game in a comparison they thought was  unfair    I know this sounds petty  and it probably is      but it sucks when you want to talk about a video game you really like  and your opinion gets shit on because it doesn t follow the general consensus  It takes the fun out of discussions    This is a more minor example  and it isn t that big of a deal  but it shows how even in a conversation about something as casual as video games  can turn to shit for no reason    I feel like the reason this site has such a toxicity issue is because a lot of Redditors wildly overestimate their intelligence  and because they re online  no one can judge them for being jerks  They act like they know everything  and can read your entire personality from a Reddit comment        Now  I won t lie  on that thread I mentioned earlier  I made some pretentious sounding comments in response to some of the other comments  But to be fair  it s hard to talk back when someone s being such an asshole  it s hard to come up with a response  Though now I ve decided not to even waste my time with those people         Look  in the end  this site is a bit of a mixed bag  There s some good  and some bad  just like anything in the world  That s just how it is  And in the end  the bad parts of this site don t ruin the positive sides  I ve had some good experiences on this site  it d be dumb to act like those don t matter because of a few jerks   Hell  even that Avengers thread I mentioned still got me some good comments  There were people legitimately willing to have interesting discussions  I just lost focus of that because some of the other people were being annoying  But the point is  this site is mostly full of some really nice and cool people  The negative aspects aren t that big of a deal  all things considered,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/ieum02/reddit_is_both_the_best_and_worst_website_ive/

rant,2020-08-23 11:28:24,I really don t know what to put here,iezpzv,3,2,Hey guys  I never thought I d rant to strangers but today s the day I guess  If you don t like personal rants I m sorry but this is one  I don t really know a specific thing to rant about so I guess I ll start with whatever I can think of  I just need these things off my chest  I m a high schooler by the way   Covid  I hate America  The coronavirus is bad but the way America is handling it is worse  The pandemic could ve ended in 4 6 weeks but no  It didn t  Because of that I ve had to miss out on summer and school  I know that s better off than so many people but I just have to say these  pathetic  things  In the 7th grade I decided I want to be a teacher  I really do  I love working with children and just watching someone understand something feels wonderful  Because of the quarantine I am missing out on my teaching internship  my school has one   I also love biology  It s so memorizing  There s tiny little processes going on in every single cell of your body  Right now you re probably going through so many things without even knowing what they are  I especially love anatomy  I m decently good at it too  I m gonna miss out on taking the course in person and oh god dissections would ve been amazing  Girlfriend  I love her  We ve been together for a year and half  not A LOT I know   But it does feel like she s the one  I m a weird kid  I m not smart or tall or hot or interesting or anything  I don t why she s with me  I don t understand how someone could actually love me  I don t know if I even deserve to be loved  My parents probably love me  My baby brother definitely does though  Anyways  I m worried  I don t know if I can give her the life she deserves  Teachers don t make a lot  And I don t want to put pressure on her  We ve talked about our future and we both want the other to pursue what they want  She s really supportive of my teaching vision but I don t know if it ll be enough  I don t know if I ll even get a job or get into college  I also think she might not like me  I ve gained some weight during covid and well  I look a lot worse  She s been busy with school work so we rarely call anymore  Actually we don t call anymore  I don t want to disturb her studying  I just wish that maybe she d want to see me sometimes  I know that emotionally  she loves me  But physically  I feel like she s disgusted by me  I ve seen the guys she s called hot or handsome  I m nothing like them  I m not blonde or 6ft or fit or white or anything  I m a 5 9 Indian kid  I m beyond ordinary  I wouldn t even be cast as an extra in a movie  I just wish maybe my girlfriend could make me feel better  But that s not her job  School college    I took AP biology last year  If you don t know  AP classes are college level classes that are just harder versions of the normal ones  At the end of the year they offer a test that gives college credit if you pass it  I didn t pass it  I mentioned before I loved biology  I m good at biology too  I know that s not humble or anything but I am  I ended with a 96 in the class  I did well on all the tests and quizzes and everything  I know I m good at it  But all the college board has told me is I got a 2 5  I can t know more  I want to quit bio  I m not worthy for it  I can t call myself a biology or anatomy teacher if I fail it  College board also has the sat  It s a test that gets you into college  I suck at the sat  The questions themselves aren t hard  I know what I m doing when I m taking it but for whatever reason I m stuck at 1200  out of 1600   I know I m not smart but I know I m not dumb either  Or atleast I think that way  Kind of sidetracked but society  Please don t make the ideal man perfect  The ideal man is 6ft  with blue eyes and a 8 inch dick  I have nothing wrong with him being absolutely jacked with 10 pack abs  I don t care about muscles or anything  I just hate that men have to be born perfect  If you re below 6ft you re below 6ft  End of story  You can t diet to change you can t hit the gym to change it you can t do anything to change it  I m stuck at 5 9 and I always will be  I m only 3 inches away but I still feel so short  I have brown eyes  Not interesting  My girlfriend thinks they re boring she has brown eyes too   They re definitely common but they aren t boring  In right light they look like honey  And in the dark they just blend in  They re fascinating  If you re a woman reading this  please I beg of you  love your boyfriend fiance husband  If they don t love you back tell them  But if they re good to you then please show it back as much as you can  If you do the right little things I promise he ll cry in joy and comfort   You ve reached the end  I don t think anyone would go through my rant  It ll be lost among many others  1 up vote by me and 0 comments  But that s not the point  It doesn t matter that nobody reads this or a thousand do  I didn t rant for feedback  I ranted to get all this stuff off of my chest  However  if you are reading this  I beg my 300 000 brown gods that you have an amazing day and that happy things happen to you

rant,2020-08-23 16:22:29,Why does love have to hurt so much ,if33c3,1,14,I m sorry if this isn t the right place for this  if it s not then tell me where would be better and I ll post it there instead    Let me start with some background about myself  I m a 26 year old male and I ve never been the person to get overly emotional about a relationship or a person  I ve had  what I feel  is a decent amount of relationships up to this point on my life  I m a great people person and don t do to bad with the ladies  That was until about 4 years ago  I also wanna preface this by saying I ve never been into the idea of getting married  I have no problem with commitment  I just never liked the idea of spending large amount of money on one day to prove my love to someone and I d rather use that money to make more exciting memories   So 4 years ago I met this girl and I immediately knew she was special  This was the first  and so far only  one I ve even considered marrying  We got along so well  we went on trips together  we could have fun going out or staying in  we both pushed each other to do the best we can at everything  we were both so supportive  we always had things to talk about  just everything felt so right  We had an absolute blast for about 2 1 2 years  but the entire time we had trust issues  Which I ve never had a problem with  but it always felt that she projected a lot of her insecurities into our relationship  Well eventually she broke up with me and shortly after I found out she cheated on me  twice  I was heart broken  I felt so betrayed and like I wasn t good enough  Which again  I ve never felt that way before  I really had thought that I found  the one  and it felt like it was just ripped away from me and there was nothing I could do     Then around last October we started talking and I decided to give her another chance  I had moved to NYC by then  for multiple reason  the timing of a lot fell in place  but one was to be further from her  and she ended up coming to see me  It was great and I felt kinda whole again  But I couldn t shake that fact that she cheated on me and when I came home for Christmas I went and saw her a few times but it just never felt right  I told her we couldn t continue  I m gonna be honest and say  I wasn t really hurt this time  I felt better because at least I had given it a shot and I knew this time it was because I wanted it    Since then she has reached out to me here and there but it s never lead anywhere because I won t let it  I don t wanna put myself in the same situation again  I thought I was really doing better and making progress forward  Until I started realizing  I have no interest in anyone  I ve gone on dates but none have lasted more than the first date  I just can t do it  I have kissed two girls and slept with one but I honestly didn t want either  I just did it hoping to feel better  I know how shitty that sounds     I haven t even tried to talk to a girl in 3 months  I compare everyone to her  I know I shouldn t but I wasn t really aware I was doing it  Anytime I think I even like someone  once we start talking  I just lose any amount of interest I had  I just kinda chalk it up that they weren t right for me  even though some have been wonderful people  I wanna say  it s not that I don t think they are good enough for me  I just don t think they re the right fit for me    I thought I just need to give myself more time  so for the past 3 months I ve been focusing more on myself  Trying to do things I enjoy and not worrying about others so much  She had messaged me about a month ago and sent me all the pictures of us from her phone and said she was deleting them  I didn t like that because it felt like she didn t want them but she wanted to push it all on me  I stayed strong and just said that I hope it helps  I thought I was doing really well  until 3 nights ago  now she s started appearing in my dreams  This is new for me since most of the time I don t have super vivid dreams  but these are crystal clear  I ll even wake up in the night and when I finally fall back to sleep  there she is in another dream  every time  I felt like I was finally making progress and now I feel worse than before  Now I m laying in bed just wishing I could talk to her    I just want to feel better and feel whole again  I wanna feel like I did before I met her  I m not saying that I wish it hadn t happened  I m glad it did  I learned so much from that relationship  more than I had learned from any other  I know that I m young and I know that I ll eventually meet someone else but I ve just never felt so damaged and broken before  If I ever have kids  not super big on that either  then I know I ll never love someone as much as I love my child  but this was a person that really changed a lot of my outlooks  This is someone I thought I could really grow with    Thanks for coming to my Ted talk    But seriously  thanks for listening to  reading  my rant  I know it s a long one  I just needed to get it off my chest  Sorry if anything is confusing  if you have any questions  comments or concerns let me know  And sorry if it s kind of a

rant,2020-08-22 17:55:27,I am afraid to leave my country and work abroad because of racism but still wish that I could just immigrate to another country and live peacefully,ieju8m,3,9,I wanted to talk about many things which are weighing down my heart and brain and causing me some mental breakdown  It became a long post so please try to read it patiently   I am an Indian Sikh with beard and turban and I have always wanted to travel the world and live in various countries  interact with people from different backgrounds  learn different languages and enjoy my life to the fullest  As I have gotten so much free time in this quarantine lockdown due to COVID 19  I thought about researching where I could live and during that research I wandered into reddit and 4chan message boards  Living in India and being a North Indian  I have never felt any kind of discrimination towards me but was always aware about the internal discrimination many East Indians South Indians had to face because of their appearance  If any East Indian or South Indian is reading this post then I am sorry you had to go through all the teasing and discrimination  not all North Indians are same  I will not say that India is a bad country to live in but there is no country which is perfect and where people don t face any kind of racial discrimination  the majority anywhere will always try to prove that they are better and superior than others   I know that the Sikhs have made a place for themselves and their religion in US UK Canada Australia but as I read through these message boards and comments I realised that there are more people who hate brown people and Sikh men in these countries and everywhere else than those who do not  White people or other POC don t say things openly because they are afraid to be labelled as racists  People on reddit will never outwardly say their thoughts because their comments may get removed  Indians are called shit skin  pajeet  towel head and various other derogatory remarks both on the internet and in real life  all these racist people have this image that all Indians have sub standard living conditions and are poor   yes  poverty is real in India and it s true that poor people have to live in slums or low residential areas but not everyone is poor and times are changing  We have people who are millionaires and billionaires in our country  people who come from middle class earning group but the government is more concerned about making these millionaires and billionaires more rich than taking care of poor and middle class people  All the politicians and governments have been corrupt till date and its just how efficiently you can hide your money or which religious group you can attract with false sense of hope and promises what makes them win elections   I am afraid of facing racial discrimination wherever I go and whichever country I move to  I want to live separate from my parents but I can t go to some of the above mentioned countries because there is one or two relatives of mine already living there and I neither want to meet them nor tell my parents that I am living in that country and city  But I am also hesitant to go elsewhere because of my brown skin and turban and always being a target for some white supremacist or other racists to mistake me for being a Muslim  with the chance of being run down on the road  beaten in an alley or shot down by a gun owner  I don t understand that why people who lose their jobs and other shit instead of thinking about why it happened to them or why they were the ones to be fired start blaming immigrants  If you had a job and you lost it  it was not because of a brown skinned turban non turban guy from India but maybe because you were hired on a contract basis and your contract expired or you were not doing your job properly and were just lazing around during work hours   It is the fault of the media that they will only show the poor areas of India and not the urban areas  News channels will show only the bad events that occur in India and not the good things that might have occurred here  YouTubers who come to India instead of showing the urban and developed areas will just travel to the poor regions and then those who watch these videos will assume that whole India is like this  I am not saying that don t show the poor areas  show them but also let the world know about the more beautiful and developed regions  they need to break the already set poor image of India  To get more views and fuel the people s image of a poor and under developed India they can try making two videos showing both sides of India   I wanted to ask a question to all the white supremacists and other POC who discriminated and said racial slurs towards people who looked different from you  do you think you will live forever  Will Jesus Christ forgive you for hating towards another human being because of his different skin colour and different religious practices  Do you think that Jesus was white and not a brown person from middle east   To those who believe in reincarnation  do you think that in the next life you will have the same skin colour and race as you have now  Don t

rant,2020-08-21 02:57:58,The customer isn t always right and I shouldn t be yelled cursed at over it ,idlxss,25,6,Hi  horribly disgruntled McDonald s worker here  I ve posted before about how I hate this job during a pandemic but now I m here because of two incidences in the past week    The first incidence is as follows   A fairly new person  think like 3 weeks  is in the second window handing out food during a lunch rush  She s doing very well  but the person in the first window somehow totally screwed up the order of cars and paid several out wrong  The new person was confused  so she called me over to assist  The man in the window said his order was two hot and spicy mcchickens with cheese and Mac sauce and a large tropic berry sprite  This order was 5th on our screen  but also ready  so I said just hand it out to him  The drink machine was still making his drink  but apparently this was a horrible travesty  This man started shouting how we needed to  hurry the fuck up   he s  at lunch   so loud that my manager could hear it from 15 or so feet away  He gets to the window and tries to defuse the man  but he starts shouting that  that bitch didn t give  him  the drink  and something about hurrying up again  My manager starts yelling back to the point I thought they were gonna throw hands through the windows  The new person asks if she can go to the bathroom  so I just said yeah because she looked shaken up  Whatever  she s new  she ll get used to this  Until she came back and we saw her eyes were red and puffy  she was crying  So my manager sent her on break  and a little while later I went to get a drink check on her  She proceeded to show me specific scars and discolorations on her arms and told me she had left an abusive relationship a few months prior and the man shouting triggered her  I told her to stay on break as long as she needed and that I d explain to the managers the situation if she was okay with it  which she was  She took her normal break and came back  but we didn t put her back in the window  Knowing that a grown ass man made my crew member cry pissed me off to no end  but she seems okay now  She didn t stay down for long and was very grateful that we had her back    Now  for today s incident   I m now the person at the first window taking money  but I m also taking orders from one of the drive through lanes  we have 2   This one may take some background information    The difference between a McDouble and a double cheeseburger is a single piece of cheese  the double cheese has 2 but a McDouble has 1  The system does not let anyone add a piece of cheese to a McDouble because that s now a double cheeseburger and should be rang in as such  We also have this  bundle  which is a McDouble and a small fry for  3    So this man comes in and asks for the  3 bundle with no mustard or ketchup  but to add mac sauce  upcharge   lettuce  upcharge   and an extra piece of cheese  I gently try to explain that I can t add cheese to a McDouble but I can give him a double cheeseburger with the modifications  however that would nullify the  3 bundle deal  This man gets irate   I ve gotten this at every other McDonald s  why are you being so difficult   To which I reply  I m just trying to ring in the correct food because the system won t let me add cheese to a McDouble because    well that s not right  You re crazy  I want a McDouble with an extra piece of cheese    Sir  that s a double cheeseburger  that one piece of cheese    no  it s fucking not  Just give me a McDouble with extra cheese  lettuce  and mac sauce   So being fed up with the man  I rang in a double cheeseburger with the specific modifications  He was then passed when the total was over  5  He asked once again why I can t make a McDouble with extra cheese  to which I literally tilt my screen toward him and attempted to show him how it literally won t let me ring it in  but he gets more mad and throws his card at me  I luckily caught it  charged it  gave it back  and said  Have a nice day  like I m supposed to  And this man says   yeah and I hope you have a shitty day  bitch   At this point  I m done caring and tell him   you re the one with the nasty attitude   He started saying more rude things that I ignored and I quickly cut him off and said  I don t have to deal with you   and slammed the window shut and walked away  I am expecting a manager to come talk to me or something  but my last day is literally 3 days from today and I couldn t care less about repercussions  He either didn t complain or my manager knew I was right because no one said anything to me    The whole point of this rant is that you should just be fucking nice to people and get your head out of your ass and listen to what the people actually running the business say  If he hadn t been a dick while ordering  I probably wouldn t have charged him for a double cheeseburger  but I needed to prove a point  Be nice to the people who are making your food  Be nice to everyone in general  Times are too crazy to be a fucking dick,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/idlxss/the_customer_isnt_always_right_and_i_shouldnt_be/

rant,2020-08-20 17:26:38,Not everyone has to have kids of their own to be fulfilled or create a family     ,idb9g8,8,2,I think it s great if you want to have kids  Personally I think even people who are anti kids of their own feel that human urge to bring a child into this world  It s innate  It s human biology   My problem is with the people that constantly say to me  oh  well maybe you ll change your mind  which has been a constant theme my whole life  I m approaching 30 now and when I was in my teens and 20s I could understand the comments  Back then I was informed  oh  well maybe you ll change your mind by the time your 30   don t forget you re still really young   My feelings haven t changed very much my whole life   The reason I don t want to have children  baby of my own  isn t because I m not up for raising a child  Personally I believe that I d be a great parent and I reckon I d really enjoy the challenge of parenthood even though it s not easy  I m always told this by people as I rapport well with children and I have my nieces and nephews as evidence of that  I have a multitude of reasons and when I explain these reasons to people it s irritating when you are met with the same comments about  changing your mind    I understand it s fantastic having a child  I understand that bringing a child of your own into this world must feel incredible   Giving them a chance to enjoy existence  Creating a family   Carrying on your name legacy  The fact they ll have your partners and your psychological physical features  continuing your genes   Having that undying love and bond with them giving and receiving unconditional love  Creating and moulding their life and raising them to love and respect others   The drive purpose meaning influence it can bring to your life   Watching them become a little walking and talking comedian  because children are hilarious  and even becoming a friend   Watching them with all their  firsts  throughout their life   Maybe even fixing the mistakes your parents may have made   The worry of who will care for you when you re older or the fear of being alone in the later years of your life or even before  The list could go on   Which brings me onto why I deny the desire to have children of my own   Future global warming environmental issues  we have no idea whether we will have an Earth we can call home e g 2050 maybe more    It s also one of the most environmentally damaging things you can do as it means using additional resources and creating more emissions through doing so   Which also brings me onto over population and having the resources to sustain life on this planet for 8 10 billion or more  population around WW1 1 5 billion and today it s 7 7 billion in approximately 100 years   An extra life on this Earth is said to create an additional 60 tonnes of co2 a year  The cost of raising a child from birth to 18  approx  100K in the UK   We also don t need to bring children into this world as we can adopt  There are already so many unwanted children in this world that need homes before I need to bring a child into it  In general the stress it can bring yourself and your partner and potential problems it may bring to your relationship  even the strongest ones   Potential disabilities and the cost stress that that may entail  I ve seen first hand parents struggling with children with disabilities and the cost strain it has put onto couples and single parents  In general it restricts spontaneity  freedom  ability to travel the world and your freedom on a day to day basis  If you want to get that freedom back it means having to get childcare for example  Therefore the extra cost difficulty that may entail if you don t have adequate support  The constant worry that they are okay  By this I mean that the world can sometimes be a dangerous playground even into their teens and adult years  Leading on from one of the pros above  it is also a mistake to believe your child will care for you or you won t be alone as not all children do stick around for their parents   Don t get me wrong  both my partner and myself constantly say that if we change our mind then we should talk about it  We always keep communication channels open and we both believe it s important to do so  We are both open to that possibility but the likelihood is slim  We are more open minded to adoption but even that seems slim at this point in our life   People believe we will both have regret or miss out on stuff if we don t have kids  Many parents say they don t regret having children which I understand due to the unconditional love you have for them  That bond in many cases is unbreakable  It is also true that parents also miss out on a lot of stuff through having children and I believe even if they don t admit it that sometimes they may even regret having children of their own  I used to wonder if this was the case and I may be very wrong  but I have read about a lot of parents speaking out about regrets anonymously online   Lastly  even a child free home means you can create a family and I don t believe a child always enriches that experience   So  next time someone says they don t want kids and not because they hate kids but because they have a valid reason  please respect that those reasons are just as valid as the reasons that made you decide to have children,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/idb9g8/not_everyone_has_to_have_kids_of_their_own_to_be/

rant,2020-08-20 20:31:27,Is there such a thing as justice ,ider1z,2,0,I don t know if this is even what this sub is for  I just feel so close to boiling over and I typed in Reddit Rant   I just don t know  guys  How does it work  Is there a force in the universe that means that what goes around comes around  Is karma a thing  Does justice  not a cosmic  holistic justice  but the man made thing  even fucking exist    The most recent three things that have me furious     My sister is a good person  She would give the extra change back to the cashier if she was given too much  She s that kind of person  Kind  thoughtful  pleasant  You know the kind of person  Usually keeps herself to herself and lives a quiet life  Then  for whatever reason some girls do  she found herself attracted to an older man  A cocky  overly confident  older man  They got into a relationship and she fell pregnant   Then the abuse began  To my knowledge it was never physical  All mental  Controlling  criticizing  correcting everything she said in front of other people  Putting her down and being a general cunt   So she left him  Brave thing to do in a small town  Which I know sounds ridiculous  but if you re not from a small town you probably cant understand the social pressure that s on people to just keep a brave face  The  now ex  boyfriend is popular  On all the sports teams  always in the pub  On the surface a nice guy   Anyway  after the baby was born my sister had decided not to put his name on the birth certificate  In Scotland  I m not sure about other locations  if the couple arent married  the mother can decide not to put the father on the birth certificate and as a result the dad has no legal obligation to the child  She had come to the decision after being told many times that he planned to take the child away from her and deny any contact   Then the texts began  She was bombarded with abuse and nastiness  It went on for weeks  The police were contacted and it was established  There s no proof that it s him    There s more  guys  You might still be reading  You re probably not  I m just letting this flow through my fingers and its like a release     I was finishing work just the other day when my phone buzzed in my pocket  It was my sister telling me that my gran had just been attacked  My gran  But she s an old lady who doesn t go out  She lives in sheltered housing  How could she have been attacked   The council have moved an alcoholic junkie into the house next to her  This lady had walked into my grans house  My gran was in the kitchen  She turned around and this lady grabbed my grandmother by the throat  With her hands clamped around her neck  she pushed her back and straight into the oven  The whole front of it shattered  I m not actually sure what happened next  I ve not been told a straight story  My sister sent me pictures of my grans injuries and the smashed oven   The police were of course involved  They came and spoke to the lady  BUT    no witnesses  It seems that the whole thing has been dropped by them   My sister has spoken to the local MP about getting the lady moved  but    fuck me  A junkie walks straight into an old ladys house at 3 in the afternoon and tries to strangle her  the police come  speak to the lady then say theres nothing that can be done and fuck off     I work for a company thats UK wide  It requires no skill  I am at peace with that  I should have tried harder at school  I shouldn t have picked the degree I did  I have no self pity  This isn t even the hand I was dealt  this is the hand I earned   Ever since I started there has been this other employee who is a bully  He s loud  Brash  Offensive  Racist  Rude  But he s careful and he s sneaky  He knows how to get away with it  He brown noses the managers and has his little posse of friend co workers who he never lets see the true cunt just below the surface   There have been several instances since I ve started of being asked what s he been up to by the other managers  It was usually just him talking down to other staff and walking a fine between being racist to the Polish coworker on my department but a few months ago he went too far in the wrong direction and was his true self to the gay member of the department  B I G  M I S  T A K E  My coworker complained and mentioned it was homophobic in nature  Boom  Red lights  Alarms  All hands on deck  This wouldn t look good to the company  An investigation was underfoot  It actually felt like we were going to be rid of this arse   We were taken one at a time into an interview  The conversations were written down word for word  I told the entire truth  I was asked to describe him  I called him a     petty and pathetic man     which he by far fucking is  Everyone else in the department was interviewed  as I mentioned  and right at the end we were told that due to the investigation  he was the right to see the transcript  Would I like my name to be omitted  I said no  I hadn t said anything in the interview I wouldn t want my name connected to  Wellllllll  it turns out I was the only one to do that  So yay   Anyway  he played the mental health card  Took sick time off with depression and anxiety  Now he s back in a different department  and it turns out he s going to come back to the original department  Nothing has changed  Not a thing   I ve lost a lot of my fire by writing this  If you ve read it all  well done  I know it s not a massive thing compared to what s happening in the world  It just when all this shit happens it really makes me wonder Whats the point  Why play by the rules if it means nothing  Arseholes win   I m not saying im a saint  But my gran and my sister  I m just sad tbh   Thank you for reading  Any of your thoughts would be much appreciated x,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/ider1z/is_there_such_a_thing_as_justice/

rant,2020-08-20 10:17:27, Flipping the Class  is Garbage Pedagogy and Here s Why,id5oc8,2,5,Hello  there  At the time of writing this I am a graduate student  One  particular method of teaching that seems to be annoyingly popular in  college is the  flipping the class  option  Now the definition of this  method can go as follows     Flipping  the classroom  also known as  inverting  a classroom  is a    pedagogy first  approach to teaching in which course materials are   introduced outside of class  and in class time is re purposed for   inquiry  application  and assessment in order to better meet the needs   of individual learners  Course materials might include readings    pre recorded video lectures  using technology such as    Panopto      or research assignments  In class activities might involve helping   students work through course material individually and in groups  among   other active learning strategies for students to gain practice applying   knowledge gained prior to class      When  they say  materials are introduced outside of the classroom  what they  mean is that they are making the students teach themselves and then  quizzing them on how they regurgitate that information without knowing  what to specifically study beforehand  In other words   you are quizzed on materials not even covered in class yet    This is made even worse if the  materials  consist of the entire  chapter with all manner of things to memorize in a day to repeat back  the next class period   If you  confront a teacher about using this method  they almost always say that   studies have shown students retain information better this way  and  that  I want to get a better feel for where the class is with respect to  the material   But there are some substantial problems with this      Teacher Obsolescence     If  we are mainly supposed to teach ourselves the course then what is the  point of paying four figures for a teacher  Seriously  if we are  introducing the material to ourselves  then the teacher becomes a  glorified powerpoint translator and test proctor  Is the teacher not  supposed to help the students learn and not just set up hoops for them  to jump through  If the response is  the teacher helps facilitate  discussions and activities  then why don t we just look up interviews  from experts who actually work in the field for  discussions  and just  use older copies of textbooks and their  activities  FOR FREE instead of  bankrolling a bunch of teachers who like to dangle students  futures on  a string in front of them like it s all a game to them     Students pay for the teacher s ego and their curiosity     Because  teachers want a very accurate level of understanding of how much the  students really know  they artificially make the course more difficult   Now plenty of teachers will boast or brush this off saying  I make them  work for an A because I care    No  you don t  You are just acting like  an educational dominatrix by making people jump through your hoops  because it suits your ego and because you have one way you want everyone  to learn  more on that later   It isn t about you  it s about the  students and how best  they   learn  By forcing the students  who are by the way adults in college   you are being manipulative and jeopardizing people s futures just so you  can polish your apples and feel good about yourself being a  tough  teacher   The good teachers motivate the students to read the material  on their own by using their ability to reach students and to make the  material palatable  Flipping the classroom is tantamount to saying  Eh  it s your problem now  figure it out yourself  I m not responsible for  your education  when you are a freaking teacher  And if the only way you  can think to make students read is to penalize them for not doing so   instead of positively motivating them  then it means you are  substantially lacking as an educator  Because you re relying on the  stick and no carrot     Colleges  Promote and advertise student body diversity  Teachers  Demand everyone learn the same way     Colleges  and universities go out of their way to form diverse student bodies   Racially  spiritually  sexually  or otherwise  They say that they do  this to bring in many different perspectives to help create a better  learning environment  So when teachers used closed form pedagogy that  demands this super diverse group of students off numerous mindsets all  learn the same way  it is ignoring the fact that different people learn  best in different ways  This willful ignorance of the fact that students  have their own studying and learning techniques  that people don t  approach materials from different vantage points or have different  methods of learning that they ve developed since high school  No no   let s do the super time consuming method that only rich white kids will  have the time for and the method that only rich white kids who can  afford to let their GPA suffer if they falter a bit due to the  adjustment will have the means to do well in  There is no point in  gatekeeping at the academic level when industries have an certification  exam  ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU WILL BE ABLE TO STUDY HOWEVER YOU WANT FOR  THAT EXAM SINCE YOU RE OUT OF COLLEGE AT THAT POINT     These mind games will be pointless anyway     It  has been shown time and again that if you don t use information  you  lose it  Most of what you will actually need will be taught to you in  your job  because by the time the information gets to a college level   it s usually already obsolete  On top of that  the odds are good that  people will forget the materials of different classes throughout college  by the time they graduate  The entire thing is a farce of education   and holding people s feet to the fire over it doesn t help  It just  shows you have no pedagogical imagination beyond making a course harder   Now  there is no way in hell an educator is going to read this and agree  with me in whole or in part  Academics are notorious for being  impossible to reach when it comes to exposing something wrong with what  they do  They re utterly convinced of their own superiority and they  disdain any doubt or dismiss it as  juvenile misconception   But this  bullshit is going to be the death of them  and the funniest part is that  they are welcoming it with open arms  All while they torpedo the GPAs  and futures of their students just so they themselves can do less work  while looking like they care,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/id5oc8/flipping_the_class_is_garbage_pedagogy_and_heres/

rant,2020-08-19 18:51:29, Keese Love  is a violent scumbag  what he did is 100 percent indefensible ,icq8gw,16,7, Trigger Warning  Description of violence against LGBT persons   random Good Samaritan Motorists   Also my own opinions which will likely piss you off       This post is about Adam Haner  Keese Love  and the Trans woman who was attacked   It is not about Jordan Hollingsworth  the man who rolled over a motorcycle                                           Heyyyyy     Genuine question for the  Anarchists  of Reddit   Is anyone who _doesn t_ buy the established narrative that Adam Haner was just some evil White Nationalist trying to drive over protesters    a  Fascist      Hmm    I disagree strongly with your quick and lazy assessment of my character    You do not know me    I m _anything but_ a  fascist     I m as gay as the sun is bright    I voted for Bernie Sanders in 2016    I am most definitely  NOT  a Trump Supporter    I consider myself to be fairly damn liberal and I try to be a Tolerant Person but what I _don t_ tolerate is information manipulation and the twisting of  or the outright ignoring of  the truth in order to adhere to a carefully selected narrative    That video going around on YouTube of the Truck side confrontation between Keese Love and Adam Haner IS NOT the  start  of the incident  Although it s still bad    and nothing at all in that video justified what happened to Adam   There is in fact  another video  one that HASN T been shared as much  not on YouTube at least     I would share it here  but since it contains disturbing imagery and extreme violence as well as torture and blood  I will  refrain  from doing so  But if you check my comments elsewhere  you will probably spot a link to it   That particular video  the 8 minute Catbox link  starts from the point of time where Keese Love and his group approach a Transgender woman outside of a 711 and become hostile with her for no other reason than perhaps an offhand remark    In response  Keese Love threatens her  has people in his group beat her up  take her skateboard and back pack  And as she is being repeatedly struck in the ribs by multiple people at the same time  she says      I m not fighting back  I just want my backpack back  My ID is in there  if I don t have my ID I can t get back in my home  I m gunna sh   t myself in the effing head now because I won t be able to get back into my home     And at some point  Adam Haner  dude in the blue Transformers shirt  comes up to try to console this visibly distraught Transgender woman and protect her from the people who were beating her up    Keese and the rest of the group didn t like being obstructed by Haner so they took their anger out on him and his wife  That lead up to the frame of time where Adam is trying to get his wife into the truck so they can leave    Instead of being allowed to leave peacefully  his wife is shoved up against the side of the driver side door of the truck  she is struck in the face multiple times and as she is dizzy and trying to get away  another female member of the entourage runs at her and tackles her from behind  holding her on the ground and repeatedly swinging at her    Adam is clearly upset at the sight of his wife getting beaten up  The whole situation probably had him in a rush of adrenaline and fight or flight instincts  People are coming at his vehicle from the sides  kicking at it  one person breaks out a window with a metal baton    Some people are briefly in the front of his truck  he revs the engine a few times and the transmission grinds its gears  so maybe THAT scared them into thinking he might try to ram them  BUT HE DIDN T  He waited for a chance when nobody was in the direct path of the truck to actually leave  He also honked multiple times as an audible signal that he was going to be moving   The activity was occurring on the sides of the vehicle  NOT IN FRONT  One person did get a foot caught  but that person was pressing themselves up against the side of truck  Being right up against the side of a vehicle you KNOW is about to start moving is pretty much asking to get a foot rolled over  They made no effort to keep a safe distance from the side of the truck  They were right up on it   There is a pretty big difference between  this  kind of incident and someone deliberately driving at 70 MPH through a line of protesters who have locked hands across a busy highway   When Adam  Peels Off  he is only caring about one thing   getting out of the situation in one piece  He is so panic stricken that he crashes his truck somewhere down the road  and when Keese s group catch up to him they drag him out and start the whole process all over again  Yelling at him  Telling him to sit down on the ground   Adam is dizzy from the impact of wrecking his truck  dizzy from the fear  and dizzy from people knocking him backwards to the ground  His wife  who ran away from the wreck not wanting to be attacked again  calls Adam s phone  It s ringing and he asks the group standing over him  My wife is trying to call me  Can I answer it     While still sitting on the ground  Adam is kicked in the back of the head repeatedly  He is quick slapped in the face  repeatedly    Adam says  I wasn t tryna hurt nobody    Keese Love becomes enraged    he says  Fuck is yew mean  yew ain t tryna hurt nobody n   a   And keeps repeatedly hitting him in the face and swinging on Adam until another person physically pulls him away from him     From Keese s perspective and the perspective of the group  Adam was trying to  Run people over    but a reviewing of the ACTUAL FULL FOOTAGE shows that when he drove off  NO ONE was directly in the front path of his vehicle when he began moving  They were all at the sides  The one dude who got a foot caught under a tire had that foot caught BECAUSE they were not a safe distance from the side of the vehicle    And there was so much going on  and so many people around the vehicle that it s entirely possible the person just kicked the truck too hard and hurt themselves and it LOOKED like they got a foot ran over    OMG  WATCH YOUR FEET    Adam honked his horn MULTIPLE times to announce his intentions to move before actually trying to drive away  There was no one IN FRONT of his vehicle  as they were all attacking it from the sides    Back to the post crash stuff     At a seemingly peaceful moment    when Adam is just on the ground looking at his phone  presumably trying to text his wife to tell her he s okay  Keese Love gets a running start from behind and comes up and SWING KICKS ADAM IN THE SIDE OF THE FACE     This instantly knocks him unconscious and the group actually laughs about it  He was not even doing anything at the point in the moment that he was kicked    He was on the ground with his legs under him  in a PASSIVE  NON COMBATIVE STATE  He wasn t lunging at anyone with a weapon  he wasn t making loud threats to do grievous bodily harm to anyone    He was simply looking at his phone   Keese Love kicked the man in the face for no good reason  And even if Adam had been  muttering racial slurs under his breath      as Keese s longtime friend and personal YouTube comment section white knight  Mobidyfid  claimed in a now deleted comment on one of the videos being spread   that s STILL not a good reason to kick someone when they are completely NON COMBATIVE    Systemic Racism  isn t an excuse to be a violent hyper aggressive douchebag to people who aren t even trying to fight you      Keese  believing he had  accidentally  murdered the man  posted to his Instagram  I might go to jail tonight for murder when all I did was fight a racist     Kicking someone in the face when they aren t even aware of your approach is not  fighting  someone  that is being a coward and attacking someone for no other reason than because you felt like it    Adam Haner survived the brutal attack  so Keese Love won t be hit with a murder charge  but there s already a manhunt underway by Portland Police who want to bring him in for questioning   Keese will more than likely go on the run     I didn t and STILL DON T buy the established narrative that Adam Haner was some evil White Nationalist just out looking to pick a fight with protesters  the video going back to when the Transgender person was being harassed and attacked shows Adam was just trying to help    _HOW MANY_ White Nationalists or Racist Extremists will stop to try and help a Trans person    I somehow doubt the number of those who _WOULD_ is all that high considering a good lot of them  hate  lgtb people      And anyone who has any other opinion than  Adam Haner was a racist bad guy who deserved what he got  gets called a  Fascist    That word is becoming so watered down and over used that it is beginning to lose its meaning     Adam was not some aggressive Proud Boy standing around and waving a Rebel Flag or threatening to stab people  He was just a random dude who was in the wrong place at the wrong time    Fascist  Yeah    How about some actual _proof_  please  And your quick judgements are not proof  3rd hand accounts are not evidence  I can  say  anything I want about you  but until I have actual proof that I can show  it is merely a quickly formed opinion   Also    I think that  Fascist  and  Racist  are just fast and easy buzz words that can be used to quickly de humanize the other person without having to use any critical thinking   When you look at the video footage that is being shared now  what difference at all is there between Keese and his friends playing Judge  Jury   Executioner and the Police doing the same kind of thing to somebody else  I mean aside from the obvious difference of the Police having GUNS    Keese Love didn t NEED a gun when his foot and running momentum could have easily caused Adam Haner to DIE or at the very least  go comatose and be laid up in a hospital for a very long time  You likely will say  Good  That s what a racist deserves   but where is the proof that he is in fact a racist  What    A meme he shared about Cannon Hinnant  That s your proof           This incident doesn t matter  and the police have more numbers than we do    I d say a group of about 20 to 30 people or more outnumbers ONE guy and his wife   You re scared of Police in riot gear roughing you up and macing you or clubbing you  well this guy was probably pretty damn scared of the crowd surrounding his vehicle and being verbally and physically hostile towards him    He was a drunk     Well alright then  that s entirely possible  but again like the Nazi accusations  I need some  PROOF  first before I ll buy that excuse    Where s his toxicology report  And even if he WAS drunk  that excuses absolutely  NO PART  of the events that transpired in the videos being circulated   Go find and watch the real  Full Video  going back to the initial confrontation between Keese and the Transgender woman  Not the one that starts out with Adam trying to help his wife get back into his Truck so they can leave the situation     Adam Haner  only  got involved because he saw someone being unfairly harassed and attacked    Sorry if the next statement I make is harsh or offensive to you     but it appears to me that Transgender Lives don t actually matter to the Cult of Social Justice  when  the circumstances mean that it might make a Person of Color look bad     The Tumblr SJWs who love to rip people apart for the slightest grievances  and talk a big game about  Intersectionality  and  We re All In This Together  and like to Reblog and Hashtag about how  Trans Rights Are Human Rights  most likely wouldn t say one unflattering thing about Keese Love and his buddies  simply because  He s a Person of Color  and that means he has  automatic  immunity from criticism or personal responsibility for his actions   I can already hear the excuses being made     Oh    well that Transgender woman probably must ve called him a racial slur  I mean nobody would just beat up a Trans person for no reason  right    And that Adam Haner guy tried to run people over  And yeah he s probably like  a White Nationalist or a Proud Boy or something      Anything at all to justify your own cognitive dissonance  I don t think the SocJus Cult really truly cares about LGBT people if it can just brush something like this under the rug and forget that it ever happened   I don t think Social Justice Warriors actually care about _real_ justice  They just want to follow the script that was written for them  never rock the boat   especially if the situation involves PoC  and if anyone ever tries to share a different opinion about something and we don t like their opinion   just call them a Racist  or a Fascist  or an anything phobe until their voice is silenced     All Cops Are Bastards  gets said quite a lot    It s understandable    people get so angry at the constant deaths or abuse of PoC at the hands of Police that they will totally agree with the idea that there are  No Good Cops     The system is set up so that cops get away with anything if they have the right friends and it s  rare  that anyone within Law Enforcement speaks out against their own   But      Nobody says  All Protesters Are Bastards  do they     No    Because we give _individual_ people  within those groups the benefit of a doubt and say that  A few violent assholes in the movement aren t representative of the whole    Interesting logic    and it gets applied _very_ selectively     I don t think  A P A B   but I think it s outright hypocrisy to not hold individuals within your groups accountable for what they do  simply out of Protester Loyalty   When Keese or some other individual does something that is indefensibly BAD  like attack a Trans woman  or run up and kick a man in the face who isn t prepared for  or even TRYING to have a fight   they are not held to the same kind of standard as we would hold Police  That s somehow  different    cops attacking citizens is super super bad  but citizens attacking citizens is just peachy   We throw an absolute fit if a Cop temporarily shuts off his Body Cam  But we re totally fine when the people organizing these protests  like Keese s buddy  D C    instruct their personal Press NOT to record the fights    I thought Press was supposed to record anything and _everything_ so that the viewer gets a full and UN manipulated scope of the events that take place   I mean    members of Cop Block orgs always record Police Interactions  REGARDLESS  of what s going on at any given moment  so in the event something DOES happen  it s caught on video and able to be spread and analyzed   If D C  doesn t want his  Press  to record fights  isn t that the same thing as a cop shutting off his body cam so he can beat the crap out of someone without worrying about the footage being reviewed later by his higher ups  Is the hypocrisy here just not graspable enough     And thank friggin  hell  multiple  individuals serving the function of  Press  disobeyed those orders from their higher ups  or we would not have gotten either the footage of the Trans woman being beaten up  or the Truck side footage where Adam and his wife are physically attacked      If your Orgs have  any  integrity at all  they will happily and voluntarily police their own members just as much as they  want  to police the Police    And just so you understand  I am  not  justifying any of what Police have been doing to the protestors in  any  state  So don t be hitting me up with some  bootlicker  ad hominem nonsense      I am talking about  Keese  here  Ok   Also  let me repeat      ANGER isn t a justification for unwarranted violence upon a person who is NOT being hostile or combative    If a cop beats someone up simply because he was irritated and pissed off and  Just caught up in the frenzy of the moment  we don t let that slide for them  so why let it slide for someone like Keese Love    I don t care what words that Trans woman was using  IF she even did    I don t care what words Adam Haner was using  IF he even did    The REAL  Full Video  is circulating    and neither the Trans woman or Adam sound like they re just dropping N bombs left and right or going out of their way to be hostile    The only people I hear dropping non stop N bombs is Keese   Friends   The only people I see being physically threatening and hostile are Keese   Friends   The REAL  Full Video  is going around and it will KEEP going around  and this narrative can NO LONGER BE CONTROLLED    D C   really  thought that he was doing a great job intimidating the Freelance Antifa Press to be willing pawns and not record this evidence of an unwarranted attack  But even the COOL people in Antifa were like  Nope  Record button go PING                   One of my friends  who is a Furry and also participates in Antifa  like    actually attends their events   tried to rationalize this attack by pointing at memes on Adam Haber s Facebook page    I love my friend to death  but he s a bit blind to the fact that his opinion is being shaped purely by third hand accounts and NOT actual video evidence  That s what being BRAINWASHED by SocJus will do to you   I do not care one little bit about what memes were on Adam s Facebook page  it is irrelevant  It does not justify the attack     That s the same type of pitiful  Past Digging  as what people tried doing to Abed Arberry to justify his death  His past is not relevant at all to what happened to him  Adam s FB page content and past activities are also irrelevant to any of what happened to him    You can t use Adam s FB content or his personal political leanings to justify a single second of what Keese Love did  It is straight up reprehensible and it has no excuse or defense      end rant                                              ADDENDUM      Keese Love attempted to make a GoFundMe for himself to get some money for  fighting a Racist   It was only up for mere seconds   Absolutely hilarious    At least he knows his audience   By the way  there is a 32 minute long video on YouTube that appears to start around a park  the individual they are harassing is someone different  as the first guy has a plain blue shirt and patterned shorts  Adam was wearing a blue Transformers shirt and plain shorts  The first

rant,2020-08-20 07:49:14,Why do people even like nintendo  They Have extremely poor product quality and a very limited auDiEnce and genre of games ,id3xph,1,8,I get people liking classic Nintendo  as classic Nintendo did some things right  not as much as Atari  SEGA  or even NEC  but still had some pretty good games and hardware for the time  But what I don t get is people liking modern Nintendo  like every home console they ve made after the N64 has been utterly worthless compared to the competition  Not only did after the PlayStation   Saturn came out did all their major third party franchises jump ship  Metal Gear  Final Fantasy  Contra  Castlevania  etc  but the hardware also greatly suffered  The N64 only had half the total processing power of the PlayStation  and was only BARELY on par with the saturn  but not by too much  The Saturn had some of the best fighting games ever made  the Playstation revolutionized the racing and stealth genres  and straight up invented survival horror altogether  What did the N64 have  A bunch of kids party games and wonky platformers  That s not much diversity  The system has only a handful of 2d action games  and NO TURN BASED RPGs to be seen   The next generation was even more pathetic for Nintendo  The Xbox absolutely DESTROYED the GameCube  and the PlayStation absolutely destroyed the Xbox in Asian territories  While the Xbox had tons of classics like Conker  Live and Reloaded  war thunder  steel battalion  Call of Duty 4  Fusion Frenzy  Mercenaries  Star Wars Battlefront I   II  Blinx Timesweeper  Dead or Alive  Puyo Pop Fever  Crazy Taxi  and of course  Halo  Combat evolved    and the PlayStation 2 had Ratchet   Clank  Final Fantasy X  Gran Turismo  Soul Calibur  Resident Evil  Metal Gear 3 and Time Crisis   But what did the GameCube have  Once again  little disveristy in games  Super Mario Sunshine  a game which played like molasses and had a lackluster attempt at open world and platforming  Super Smash Bros Melee  a fun game for parties or tournaments  albeit one where the novelty wears off fast  Pokemon XD  Gale of Darkness  which I have nothing bad to say about  it s one of the best and most unique Pokémon games in the entire series  and Starfox Adventures  which is pretty fun  albeit feeling kinda lacking in the longevity of content   So I m extremely disappointed and always been consistently underwhelmed by Nintendo  I was so underwhelmed by the N64  that I asked my parents to return it to the store and exchange it for a PlayStation less than 2 weeks in  I got a SEGA Saturn not too long after  and I have no regrets  I haven t touched any Nintendo console but the GB C  DS 3DS Switch since  The Wii just looked to childish and lacking in games  the Wii U just looked like a straight up waste of money  I never got around to buying the GBA due to me having to penny pinch  and the GameCube looked wimpy in comparison to the Xbox   I ve switched to Xbox since it came out and gotten much greater satisfaction than the equivalent Nintendo consoles of that generation  Sony is alright  but I hate their business model and their UI is always dated and clunky  running worse than Android 3 0 from decades ago  Sony has some pretty cool games though  but the Wii Wii U  I just saw poor quality ports and again  underpowered hardware and lack of diversity in games   A lot of people think I m stupid for liking Xbox over Nintendo  but really  I know I m not alone  Is there anyone else out there who hasn t liked any newer Nintendo consoles  Cause they just remind me of how Atari and SEGA stopped making consoles  and that is a damn shame considering the market  I bought the Jaguar in around 2003 and it s a sad story cause the system has a ton of potential  Even I barely knew about it s existence cause the PlayStation absolutely smothered it   Has anyone else had a similar experience  If so  did you give up after the N64  Or did you wait till one of the following generations to do so,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/id3xph/why_do_people_even_like_nintendo_they_have/

rant,2020-08-20 00:31:34,Ranting about my childhood and my ex and my mental health ,icwx9k,1,0, My childhood    When I grew up I only ever had 2 friends at a time at maximum  There were these 2 girls  1 of which I was only friends with because of the other  both of which bossed me around and were pretty rude for like 5    year olds  Eventually when the kinder one moved away I was left alone because the ruder friend left me for a group of girls so I was left alone for however long that was    My memory this far back is very fuzzy and jumbled up    I recall hanging around with my brother and cousins for a majority of my junior school because I was incapable of making friends and felt bad about leaving them behind  and also because I felt like they would judge my new friends for whatever reason so I was afraid for stupid reasons also    Being the oldest out of all of them I would always move into older schools first and be left alone  so due to my lacking of social skills I started following around this guy in my year and trying to involve myself as best as I could  despite never being accepted into the friend group so I just followed them all around like a leech parasite    Around 10 years old I made a  friend  who was obsessed with pokemon  It was literally the only thing he talked about ever ever  Which wasn t bad because I also liked pokemon  but it seemed he _only_ liked pokemon  I would leave my lessons for break lunch time only for him to wander over to me to talk about pokemon and it drove me nuts inside  but I didn t want to tell him due to fears of losing the closest person I had outside of my family  The entire time I was just waiting for the bliss of him leaving because he was in the year ahead so I couldn t wait to be free of the repetitiveness of all my free time    When the next school year started I was left alone as my cousins moved to another school and my brother had his own seperate friend group  I recall a memory of me being perplexed and working up the courage to ask my brother  how do you have so many friends    I don t remember his response  likely for the better lol  Anyway  during my time at this school I developed a crush on a girl and tried to get to know her by looking at her from across the classroom and not talking to her aha  Fortunately I was acquaintances with her friends  but due to my insecurities I never tried to get too close because I knew feared they always spoke of me as I was the only boy out of them all  so I literally distanced myself despite wanting to get to know them    This entire time period I had people that disliked me  That bullied me  I can recall all of their names recount all the things they called me  and all the things they threw at me during classes  I remember all the times they broke me down into tears in the middle of a classroom and how I was so shy that I simply tried to hide it  except it was obvious every time because the people around would always get so awkward and not want to talk about the quiet boy that was crying    The bullies and cunts were different people every few years  from around 5 to 15 years old is my guess  I remember asking one of the bullies at some point  why do you all pick on me all the time   and I was answered simply with  I don t know  we just do   That memory will never leave me    After I moved to secondary school I hung around the only kid I knew of that didn t bully me  yet was also a loud irritating prick constantly pissing off the people around him with weird noises and an obsession with minecraft and the likes  Through him however I became part of a larger friend group 2 years or so latrer  to which I was the brunt of the litter  There were 2 kids that constantly picked on me and would fuck around with my lunch and throw shit at me during my free periods  I couldn t internalise all of that anger daily and eventually I snapped  but being the non violent person I am I just made a fool of myself and ran away to which one of my teachers found me and let me hide in his class  Embarrassment ensued as my crush  a different person now  and all the other people in my year would have to walk past to go to their classes and look in on me crying alone    Looking back now at this stuff  it s no wonder I snapped so often at my brother s friend  I feel bad for upsetting him often  however I was truly oblivious the entire time as he too would hide away whenever he cried    Out of the larger friend group I was a part of  I made a true friend that I am still in contact with to this day  and he has told me that he feels bad for all the tormenting I went through from the 2 other kids    After secondary school I started college and started studying 3 miserable subjects  maths physics and further maths  I had the chance of choosing resistant materials  where you build projects and document them  which I know I would have loved because I had previously aced that same subject in my older school  however because I was so pressured when being asked on what I wanted to take I picked further maths  and I hated every minute of it    For the first few months I had no friends besides a few girls I knew from my old crush  who d have thought  and some guys in my further maths group  I wasn t particularly close to any of these people  and the daily grind of misery was horrid  Learn subjects I don t enjoy  with teachers I didn t like  and spend my free time with people that felt like a chore to be with    Later on I was lucky enough to befriend 2 guys who I consider to be 2 of my best friends to this day  but at the time sadly I only saw them as reminders of college and didn t develop our friendships that much over the entirety first year that I was there    After this year  my 2 friends from further maths stopped studying further maths and I had nobody in my class to talk to  in a class of around 15  Everyone else already had their own friend groups and I was isolated alone  barely getting by with my lack of socialising skills    On one hand  I was getting on very well with my 2 new friends and enjoying all my spare time  On the other hand  I was doing terribly in my subjects for the first time ever  Where previously I was top of the class constantly and not being the best hurt me deeply to the point of tears  For the entire 2 years that I was there  despite my constant efforts at studying I was getting worse and worse grades  My physics teacher mocked me in front of another teacher and one of my friends for 2 ridiculous errors in one of my exams  My friend still remembers this  and while it is funny to look back on  it was really a very rude thing for him to have done in such a mocking way  My maths teacher wasn t helping much by telling me to go for the  low hanging fruit  and not much more  and my further maths teacher was telling me for the entire last year about my improvement and when it got to the week before the exam she literally told me not to take it because she was so certain I would fail    She knew it  I knew it    I remember the feeling of dread as I read my exams thinking  I ve seen this before  I have no idea how to do it though   and just giving it my best shot  I pushed through with all of my exams and passed everything  getting the lowest grade in further maths available and getting moderate at best grades in everything else    I was super lucky to have even made it into university  I didn t get into any of my 5 options and had to study an extra year this year to compensate for my grades  yet I made it  not including the single exam I have to retake this summer             her    I met a girl online almost exactly 2 years ago as of now    I met her half way through college through a mutual online friend  We became close friends and messaged and called each other daily from the start  hitting it off perfectly  Coincidence or not  I met her while I was in the middle of college  One could say I  needed  her because of my lack of relationship experience  and simply my general lack of friendships at the time  To this day my friends blame her and the game we d play together for the poor grades I got    During the entire time I knew her  she was always the one I would be talking to at almost any point  I looked past her flaws and the red flags and painted a picture in my mind of who I thought she was  I was putting up with her stubborn ass daily  and how she  hated to repeat herself  which is fair enough  but given my poor listening talking skills a lot of conversations just went over my head    Regardless  we eventually developed strong enough feelings for each other and so we eventually went out of our ways to meet up in person little under a year ago  so pretty much after we d known each other for a year    We both took up summer jobs to pay for my travel costs and I spent about 2 3 months working in a restaurant to get the money I needed  I travelled across europe in almost a 24 hour journey by car ride  2 trains and a plane  she was from a rather separated city   We connect naturally and have a good time together and get intimate over the nights and I even got to meet her friends and have meals with her mum  We went to a party together  I had my first kiss with her  we got drunk together and the lot   After I return home I had to travel to university for the first time ever and to live alone  and it was around this time that she had seemingly cut all contact with me and wouldn t return any of my messages or calls  which was a huge contrast to the year straight daily phone calls messages face times we exchanged   To this day I have no idea why she did this and I can t shake it off my mind  just the idea that I spent all that time and energy getting to know her and all the moments we shared together lead to nothing    She began contact again on literally christmas day  that is 3 months after we lost contact and in the moment I was filled with relief that I just accepted contact and carried on for another month or 2  During this entire time period I was pissed off at myself for ignoring the 3 months of silence and her for putting me through it    I finally mustered the courage to explain that I was unhappy and I told how angry I was at being put through 3 months of silence after moving into some where new without contact with  the person who meant the most to me     To this day  since that conversation  we have had almost no contact with each other and whenever we do cross she acts as if nothing happened  I can t stand it    She torments my mind on a daily basis and just the thought of her pisses me off  It pisses me off that I still have her on my mind after all this time  It pisses me off that she pisses me off  It feels like it s been long enough that it s silly to bring up my struggles with my friends family           Mental health    At some point in secondary school my friend started the idea of mental health by introducing me to the topic of ADHD  saying if it had ever occurred to me that I could have it  I resonated with the symptoms deeply and so I brought it up with my parents  They took me as being a silly  overly scared child and brushed it off  however I pestered them enough with my concerns and my mum took me to the GP where I was barely even involved with the conversation that went on  It was simply shut down and put down to  exam stress   I was pissed off at my inability to speak up and control the conversation    Thankfully I used my anger and used it as a fuel and started taking note of my symptoms and examples in the 2 years since  I was able to conclude logically that the problem was not exam stress because I was still experiencing the symptoms in time periods where there were not exams at all  Over time I had taken many many notes of symptoms and so when I moved out alone I was finally in control of how things were in my life    After procrastinating joining a GP I finally worked up the courage to go outside and do it  It took about a month in total to officially join      I booked an appointment at the GP and was told to come back next week for another GP to see me  I was told my symptoms sounded like ADHD  Autism and Bipolar and was told to come back next week for another GP to see me  I was told my symptoms lined up with ADHD  anxiety and depression and was referred to an autism centre and for a blood test  That part took about 2 weeks      I was then referred for a piss test  That also took 2 weeks      Then the Austim centre finally sent out the various forms surveys  That took another 2 weeks for filling in  returning  waiting  filling and returning again      Turns out that I do not have autism  Then I was referred to a psychiatrist  Hurrah    And then COVID 19 struck  Appointment cancelled    I phone up  what can I do for my appointment     Thankfully I can have a phone call appointment in a months time    I waited out the months time period and woke up in time  eagerly waiting for the phone to ring    And there was no phone call  My memory is foggy here  however I remember I had to wait another week for a phone call for whatever reason  I list off my general symptoms and tell of my concerns of ADHD and I am to have a booked appointment in January 2021  D   meaning that  as of the start of this ADHD journey I have had to wait an entire year for my first appointment    I ve heard of worse but good grief this is killing me inside  with my mum trying to brush off the whole idea and my dad as nonchalant to this whole idea  as he is for every other concern of mine      This sums up pretty much everything that bothers me right now that floats inside my head  aside from my irritating and distant family  There isn t much to say about them  except for the overall lack of closeness and emotional support  but I have my friends now for that      I m trying my best  I m sorry if I sound like a whiny bitch  I just have constantly have anger bottled inside me that I have learned to contain over my life  There are other things too but they re just fluttering thoughts in my head that I lose within an instant  I hate raging over my life like this  I never complain IRL because I know other people have so much worse  But at the same time I feel like I too have it pretty bad  but having this comparison feeling feels so unjust      Tl Dr  Shitty

rant,2020-08-19 09:04:23,Literature classes are dogshit and easily worse than all of the other common core subjects ,ici77r,6,1,I love some good writing  I love texts with deeper meaning  I like a lot of poetry  I see nothing wrong with trying to teach any of this  and I think it s all very interesting  My view on this has changed drastically from a couple of years ago  when I couldn t have cared less  But I definitely appreciate it now   What I DON T like is when an English class forces you to read some book that is terribly written and then makes you talk about how great it is  Not all books are actually  deep  or  meaningful   In fact  most of them aren t  So why do they ALWAYS pick the most shallow books that parrot the same 3 topics and sound like they are written by a 5th grader with a thesaurus   What makes a book  powerful  to someone is incredibly subjective  It is incredibly annoying when someone is making you write about how great something is when you do not agree with it at all  It s completely disingenuous and takes away from the whole point of analyzing texts   Finding the deeper meaning  no longer becomes actually analyzing the text to see how certain themes or moods are conveyed  it becomes a painful process of trying to bullshit through the whole thing in the most shallow way possible  None of this is important  None of this is interesting  Nobody gives a shit about any of this  It is no more than a chore  because of how we are forced to conform to one idea  Any essay just becomes a whole bunch of paragraphs making up a bunch of shit to try and satisfy the requirement instead of actually writing about meaningful things   I ask all of my old classmates  ALL of them  about this one book we are reading  Not a single person enjoys any of it  It s not just boring  it is just terribly written  Despite this we all have to jack off the author for their  aMaZiNg wRiTiNg  every ten pages or so  Any joy in analyzing literature is completely sucked out in literature classes because free thinking is eliminated and it s all about trying to satisfy whatever the teacher wants you to say   By having all of these dumb fucking requirements  any concept of depth in literature classes is eliminated  No  you can t deviate from the essay template you used 5 years ago to talk about actually interesting concepts  that would make too much sense  You have to repeat the same thing over and over because creativity and analytical thinking is actively punished in the most ironic way possible   TLDR  Literature classes actively punishing actual analytical thinking because it just becomes a chore of trying to figure out what satisfies the teacher the most  It s not interesting  it s not meaningful  and nobody is genuine in what they write  because it is designed to make all of those things impossible,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/ici77r/literature_classes_are_dogshit_and_easily_worse/

rant,2020-08-18 19:39:56,History lesson for the  HERITAGE NOT HATE  crowd,ic4ijg,12,4, If you are confused as to why so many Americans are defending the confederate flag  monuments  and statues right now  I put together a quick Q A  with questions from a hypothetical person with misconceptions and answers from the perspective of an AP U S  History Teacher   Q  What did the Confederacy stand for   A  Rather than interpreting  let s go directly to the words of the Confederacy s Vice President  Alexander Stephens  In his  Cornerstone Speech  on March 21  1861  he stated  The Constitution    rested upon the equality of races  This was an error  Our new government is founded upon exactly the opposite idea  its foundations are laid  its corner stone rests  upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man  that slavery subordination to the superior race is his natural and normal condition  This  our new government  is the first  in the history of the world  based upon this great physical  philosophical  and moral truth    Q  But people keep saying heritage  not hate  They think the purpose of the flags and monuments are to honor confederate soldiers  right   A  The vast majority of confederate flags flying over government buildings in the south were first put up in the 1960 s during the Civil Rights Movement  So for the first hundred years after the Civil War ended  while relatives of those who fought in it were still alive  the confederate flag wasn t much of a symbol at all  But when Martin Luther King  Jr  and John Lewis were marching on Washington to get the Civil Rights Act  1964  and Voting Rights Act  1965  passed  leaders in the south felt compelled to fly confederate flags and put up monuments to honor people who had no living family members and had fought in a war that ended a century ago  Their purpose in doing this was to exhibit their displeasure with black people fighting for basic human rights that were guaranteed to them in the 14th and 15th Amendments but being withheld by racist policies and practices   Q  But if we take down confederate statues and monuments  how will we teach about and remember the past   A  Monuments and statues pose little educational relevance  whereas museums  the rightful place for Confederate paraphernalia  can provide more educational opportunities for citizens to learn about our country s history  The Civil War is important to learn about  and will always loom large in social studies curriculum  Removing monuments from public places and putting them in museums also allows us to avoid celebrating and honoring people who believed that tens of millions of black Americans should be legal property   Q  But what if the Confederate flag symbol means something different to me   A  Individuals aren t able to change the meaning of symbols that have been defined by history  When I hang a Bucs flag outside my house  to me  the Bucs might represent the best team in the NFL  but to the outside world  they represent an awful NFL team  since they haven t won a playoff game in 18 years  I can t change that meaning for everyone who drives by my house because it has been established for the whole world to see  If a Confederate flag stands for generic rebellion or southern pride to you  your personal interpretation forfeits any meaning once you display it publicly  as its meaning takes on the meaning it earned when a failed regime killed hundreds of thousands of Americans in an attempt to destroy America and keep black people enslaved forever   Q  But my uncle posted a meme that said the Civil War Confederacy was about state s rights and not slavery   A   A state s right to what     John Green  Q  Everyone is offended about everything these days  Should we take everything down that offends anyone   A  The Confederacy literally existed to go against the Constitution  the Declaration of Independence  and the idea that black people are human beings that deserve to live freely  If that doesn t upset or offend you  you are un American   Q  Taking these down goes against the First Amendment and freedom of speech  right   A  No  Anyone can do whatever they want on their private property  on their social media  etc  Taking these down in public  or having private corporations like NASCAR ban them on their properties  has literally nothing to do with the Bill of Rights   Q  How can people claim to be patriotic while supporting a flag that stood for a group of insurgent failures who tried to permanently destroy America and killed 300 000 Americans in the process   A  No clue   Q  So if I made a confederate flag my profile picture  or put a confederate bumper sticker on my car  what am I declaring to my friends  family  and the world   A  That you support the Confederacy  To recap  the Confederacy stands for  slavery  white supremacy  treason  failure  and a desire to permanently destroy Selective history as it supports white supremacy   It s no accident that   You learned about Helen Keller instead of W E B  DuBois  You learned about the Watts and L A  Riots  but not Tulsa or Wilmington   You learned that George Washington s dentures were made from wood  rather than the teeth from slaves   You learned about black ghettos  but not about Black Wall Street   You learned about the New Deal  but not  red lining    You learned about Tommie Smith s fist in the air at the 1968 Olympics  but not that he was sent home the next day and stripped of his medals   You learned about  black crime   but white criminals were never lumped together and discussed in terms of their race   You learned about  states rights  as the cause of the Civil War  but not that slavery was mentioned 80 times in the articles of secession   Privilege is having history rewritten so that you don t have to acknowledge uncomfortable facts   Racism is perpetuated by people who refuse to learn or acknowledge this reality   You have a choice    Jim Golden
