philosophy,2020-06-08 16:42:37,Open Letter to Steve Huffman and the Board of Directors of Reddit  Inc  If you believe in standing up to hate and supporting black lives  you need to act,gyzk4e,5316,0,  Please don t give this gold    The account is our trusty bot  so it won t be useful to anyone  We d rather have you donate to your local Black Lives Matter organization   Here is a list of suggestions     The following is an open letter we  the moderators of  r philosophy  signed  You can find the original post on  r AgainstHateSubreddits  You can find our previous  short statement against racism  here    Dear Steve   On June 1  you shared a letter on Reddit s blog    Remember the Human   Black Lives Matter      In this letter  you claim  as Snoos  we do not tolerate hate  racism  and violence  and while we have work to do to fight these on our platform  our values are clear     As of today  neither you nor any other Reddit admins have shared this letter anywhere on reddit com  However   the response to this message was swift on Twitter     where you were rightfully labeled as hypocritical based on your long and well recorded history of defending racism and white supremacy on this site     Among the many responses was this message from former CEO of Reddit  Ellen Pao      I am obligated to call you out  You should have shut down the_donald instead of amplifying it and its hate  racism  and violence  So much of what is happening now lies at your feet  You don t get to say BLM when reddit nurtures and monetizes white supremacy and hate all day long    Many others shared links and screenshots of your past statements saying   Open racism and slurs are fine to post on Reddit     The problem of Reddit s leadership supporting and providing a platform for racist users and hateful communities has long been an issue   Nearly six years ago   dozens of subreddits signed the original open letter to the Reddit admins   calling for action   While  the Reddit admins acknowledged the letter   and said it was a high priority to address this issue  extremely little has been done in the intervening years   On June 5  you shared this update on  r Announcements   Upcoming changes to our content policy  our board  and where we re going from here    In the post  you stated that there is a need for continued adjustments of Reddit s content policy to address racism and that this remains a priority   These continued statements that you hear us  that this is a priority  or that you are working on it are not enough   It has been five years since your return as CEO and this still remains Reddit s most glaring problem   Steve  if you and Reddit genuinely care about the values of standing up to racism and hate  then you need to back it up with real action   As moderators on this website who have dedicated countless hours to keeping this site running  we call on Reddit to take the following steps       Enact a sitewide policy against racism  slurs  and hatespeech targeted at protected groups    For too many years  Steve Huffman and the other Admins have stood by and allowed this site to fester with hate in the name of  free speech    It is time to enact a specific and detailed policy that protects the disadvantaged members of our communities from hate based on their sexuality  gender identity  ethnicity  country of origin  religion  or disability       Be proactive in banning hate based communities    In the past Reddit has only taken action on hate subreddits when they were featured in the news and risked Reddit s reputation or when they were documented and featured on  r AgainstHateSubreddits and other forums   AHS should not have to be responsible for raising awareness of hate subreddits and reporting them to the admins   This site should take responsibility for keeping its users safe by banning any remaining subreddits devoted to hate and racism and preventing the creation of hateful subreddits in the future        Be proactive in banning hate users   Reddit needs to not only ban hate subreddits  but must be proactive in banning the moderators of these subreddits and their most active users   Too often these users have been allowed to stay on this website after numerous sitewide violations  letting them move on to participate in new hate communities and spread their vitriol further across this site       Reddit needs to hire more minorities   women  especially in leadership roles   Reddit needs to hire more women and people of color   particularly in leadership roles in the company   to help shift the corporate culture and policies to be more equitable for all   In addition  Reddit needs to take adequate steps to protect these employees from harassment        Reddit needs to hire more community managers   According to Reddit s  job listings   there are dozens of open positions that the company is hiring for  and yet not a single one for Community   Reddit has enacted numerous policies over the years that have been detrimental to the ability of Reddit s moderators or the broader Reddit community   Reddit needs more community managers to build positive relations and engagement with the site s volunteer moderators       Honor Alexis Ohanian s wishes to have his Reddit Board seat filled with a black candidate     On June 5  Reddit Co Founder and Executive Chairman  announced that he would be stepping down   from his role on Reddit s Board of Directors   Alexis requested that his position be filled with a black candidate and we ask Reddit to honor that request   While you have stated your intent to honor that request  we are asking for an announcement to be made on this decision in the next 3 months   We believe this is not an issue that should be put off for action years down the road   At  r AgainstHateSubreddits  we have laid out the many failures of Steve time and again to stand up to white supremacy on this site  time    and  time    and  time    again  With a website with the impact of Reddit on the broader conversations being held in communities around the world  this website needs real leadership and real action   We hope that Reddit will not just share empty platitudes   but will take a meaningful stand against hate  and take these recommendations to heart  This letter is co signed by more than 200 communities representing well over 200 million subscribers    r

philosophy,2020-08-15 00:47:27,Strangeness of Death  Phenomenological Experience of Life and Existence,i9v2ux,6,4,Observations in evolutionary theory have abstracted that  living beings  follow the common function of survival and reproduction  with reproduction generally acting as a strategy for survival  i e   transference of genes to the next  generation     This includes or at least allows strategies that seem escape the definition of   living    such as in the case of Mitochondria  organisms that   sacrificed life   to become an integral part of a cell system   The deeper one delves into the workings of life and  to a certain degree existence itself  the more one begins to beg the question    If the function is survival  why death    Why  bother  to exist  Somehow  the question is redundant  not even intriguing  It feels as if it s a fallacy  especially when considering the second law of thermodynamics  The question seems to be making a number of assumptions already   But now ask yourself    In which organ of the body do  YOU  reside in  With which organ do  YOU  identify with    Chances are  you d point out at your head  recognizing the organ we call  brain  as the one  If you d cut your arm  you d hardly identify it as  you  on a pile  or set  of arms  It s  yours  but it s not  you   But  chances are that you d still identify with your brain  even if it were removed from your body and placed somewhere else   This exercise probes deeper into the issue of consciousness and identity  bringing awareness to the boundaries of life and death  The exercise brings us to the following question    Is your arm a living thing    According to certain scientists  an arm meets the criteria that defines  life  or  living    What s strange about this question  and of the relationship between an arm and brain  is that an arm doesn t seem to have consciousness  It s primarily controlled by the somatic nervous system  the  voluntary  system of the PNS division of the human nervous system  whereby sensory and motor neurons  make it move   This implies that somehow cutting or blocking information transmission of those neurons renders the arm  unusable  by the brain  by  you     Since understanding of consciousness is still developing  I m going to make the assumption that an arm  or leg  or nose  or eye   when devoid of consciousness   resembles  an inanimate object  even though it meets the criteria for  living  or  alive   Under this assumption  it s strange to experience what seems to be deliberate  voluntary  or conscious  animation  of a structural adaptation such as an arm  The structure is  inanimate   yet through sensory and motor neurons that are connected to both the central nervous system and peripheral nervous system  you can make it move  you can animate it  It s as if you can replace a human arm with a piece of metal and  through various  nervous  connections  you can begin to  animate  and move that piece of metal around   Without such connections  and without deliberation  the arm scarcely moves by itself    Scarcely    not at all   It s strange to think that a presumably inanimate  living  object can be moved through another living object where consciousness  seems to be   It s also strange that something that seems to be inanimate  is alive  not  dead   That s generally the case with viruses  where it s largely unknown as to whether they re  alive  or  not alive     Of course  is voluntary  deliberation  the same as consciousness  Is  not alive  the same as  dead   I don t know  I m also not sure what I m trying to point out with this post  There s a number of assumptions that I m making  but I can t see them  All I know is that life  death  existence  and consciousness are strange  I find that wondrous,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/i9v2ux/strangeness_of_death_phenomenological_experience/
philosophy,2020-08-13 15:10:01,My defense of utilitarianism  a response to an answer in r askphilosophy,i8yqzm,5,13, Here is the link   where u drinka40tonight answered a question regarding utilitarianism  and shared  some of the issues that the utilitarian has to contend with   So without further ado  I want to address that right now     x200B   1  A utilitarian doesn t throw people to the lions to satisfy sadists  because this sadism requires sacrifice when there could be none  We oppose things like cock fighting  throwing people to the lions  etc  because though there may be some amount of pleasure involved for some sadists  the greater good is getting to a state where there s enjoyment with no sacrifices  But also  rights don t exist  I do not believe rights are absolute under utilitarianism  Sure  if we lived in a society where everyone could  and would  follow act utilitarianism perfectly  the rights would serve no purpose  However  since we are flawed  rights may serve to increase utility overall  and probably do so  John Stuart Mill was a staunch defender of various rights  perhaps to a fault  in some cases   But what does it mean to  have  a natural or moral right  Is it like a metaphysical liver you carry around with you  Of course not  Saying something like   I have a right to be free from violence  is just a shorthand for  I should be free from violence  or  other people shouldn t commit violence against me   Instead of moral rights  we can get by just using  should  or  ought  statements  which can be grounded on well being  2  Utilitarianism is very demanding  and I might even say that there s a really high bar to be a  good person   and most of us aren t  including me  You could take it as  becoming a truly good person is literally a life goal  But at the same time  the bar is not impossibly high if we can keep a realistic view of what s  possible  for us  since utilitarianism prescribes to do what s best within what we  can  do  Maybe the best thing I could do right now is giving up all my possessions and do every single thing I can to establish communism  this might be true  but I don t think I actually have the willpower to devote myself on the level of a great revolutionary  and maybe I can t actually do that merely because I can imagine it  We also have to work with our strengths and what s easiest for us to do effectively  and we all have mental blockages that prevent us from doing seemingly easy things  let alone hard things  Also  free will doesn t exist  but that s a long topic  3  Your wife  i e  her being alive and happy  can actually be worth infinitely many twinkies if you think that s the right utilitarian metric to use  unless producing that many causes the oceans to be filled with them or something  The basic response to all these reductio ad absurdums is that if the way we aggregate utility seems wrong  the metric can easily be changed  The question itself isn t ridiculous though if we go fully jokerfied  there is a logically and physically possible scenario where you can only choose A  to save your wife from death  or B  to save a big barrel of X number of twinkies  Easy choice unless the twinkies can literally save people s lives or something As for comparing apples and oranges  a first point is that we re not actually comparing different categories of things  we re always comparing mental states in my view  I think what has intrinsic value  in and of itself  in isolation   is an experience  all the qualitative contents of consciousness you feel in one moment at a time  So for example  when we compare  your wife  with  twinkies   we re specifically talking about comparing all the experiences your wife  and everyone she affects  will have if she lives  versus all the experiences twinkies might provide to you or other people  So I m always just talking about the quality of our mental states i e  experiences  since I argue those are what fundamentally matter  The question is just  can we compare all mental states groups of mental states  Or to be more clear  obviously we can write down all possible mental states randomly and say  this is our scale  if we want to  But we mean to ask  is every possible mental state from  mild nausea  to  orgasmic bliss  actually arranged from worst to best  either ordinally or cardinally  in the same way  that we could arrange a classroom by height using a ruler  The answer is yes if we decide on a certain kind of ruler  and a certain kind of quantity we re measuring then the thing we re measuring will stack up in some way  Even if it s not something we can do as clearly or precisely as lining people up by height  If we use some concept of  better  and  worse  then this is doable  Let s say we re examining all the kinds of experiences we could have  one by one in isolation and unconnected to any consequences and trying to place them in order from  worst  to  best   For starters  I think we can objectively say a mental state of torture is worse than a mental state of  eating ice cream   if worse means anything  So it should be a given that we can compare at least some mental states quite easily  There are many mental states we can say are  up there  on the scale  and many clearly  at the bottom   There are also tons I would have no idea where to place  but that might have certain bounds  I don t know exactly where to place a feeling of  mild giddiness before performing a song  on this theoretical scale  but I could at least say it s better than many kinds of boring experiences  but also not as good as some of the best experiences  Whatever the result of this task however accurate or ill defined our ordering system is we will end up having to place a single metric on different outcomes for mental states in any situation  We want a  complete  moral system  that s why we re engaged in moral philosophy  In every physically and logically possible scenario  we want a system that tells us the right decision  or set of morally permissible decisions  to make  that s what we ve set out to do  If A  the quality of our mental states is what matters  and B  we must decide the better path in any imaginable scenario  then we have no choice but to go by a single metric to compare as best we can  even if our comparison system is sloppy as hell  4  All conscious creatures must be included  because the conscious experience is what has intrinsic value  This includes humans  animals  even insects which almost certainly have consciousness  but it s understood a fly is probably not having as vivid or as painful experiences as us  We have to consider the effects of our actions as far into the future as we can predict  there s no reason to think the well being of someone in the future is more or less important than someone s well being right now  just like there s no reason to think someone across the globe is less morally significant than someone right next to you  The net utility doesn t change that rapidly moment to moment  but any changes that do happen are just updates on what the best course of action is  Just going by aggregate happiness would lead to some absurd conclusions  so it s something much closer to average happiness  but this is more getting into the weeds  5  I don t think we have to make utilitarianism the publicly accepted moral system  That would be about as restrictive and unlikely as enforcing one religion  It s fine if people never even use the word utilitarianism so long as we have a society geared towards well being  6  We can t mix utilitarianism and egoism  a utilitarian values  not just the happiness they get  but the happiness other people get  I actually value my friend s experiences  these have equal weight to my own  Maybe your issue is that I m valuing my friend s  happiness  like it s some kind of object  but not  my friend himself   But there is no self  we are our experiences  the  self  is a stream of experiences  aka consciousness   Valuing my friends  experiences means valuing my friend as my friend  the experiences literally are us  Friends aren t replaceable either  there are kinds of deep trust and empathy that can only be gained over years  I can t have the same convos and kinds of happiness with a friend that I have with other people  It s hard to replace that  and special connections between people improve all our lives in terms of well being  The happiness I get from a new friend may not be as good as the kind I get from an old friend  though if it is  who cares,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/i8yqzm/my_defense_of_utilitarianism_a_response_to_an/

philosophy,2020-08-09 20:29:53,A I doesn t need to surpass human intelligence to control humanity and It s already the case ,i6n9dl,192,123,Elon Musk fears DeepMind could be potentially harmful for humanity if it surpasses human intelligence    Elon s hypothesis are that   1  AI does not control humanity  Implied   2  AI can surpass intelligence   through the concept of  Strong A I    3  AI can be harmful if it surpasses human intelligence    My antithesis is that   1  AI in its simplest form  like Weak AI  does in fact control humanity and it does not need to surpass human intelligence to do so     1 a AI will become more and more effective to control humanity    1 b In its actual form  weak AI s control over humanity is harmful because it is business oriented   2  If AI becomes  Strong  then it could be even more harmful and we would never know about it in time to prevent it     Development     1  AI in its simplest form  like Weak AI  does in fact control humanity and it does not need to surpass human intelligence to do so   A I does not need to surpass human intelligence to control our lives   Our lives is already controlled by machines and algorithms  It goes from practical things like relying on digital platforms to be able to book a flight  or getting in touch with our friends and family  to the choices we make on a daily  which are subconsciously influenced by our digital content consumption  which we are  again  already dependent from      1 a AI will become more and more effective to control humanity   A I is becoming a more interconnected part our lives and in it s  weak  form  it is already partly manipulating our choices while maintaining the false impression of free will  At some point  all human nodes that are the input of making choices  emotions  value  education  memory will be entirely based on an experience of reality that is the product of A I  ultimately leading us to make choices that are themselves going to perpetuate this reality   Again this is already the case and is an ongoing process  you phone doesn t listen to you  it just knows faster than you what you think you want   Following that logic A I could go as far as giving you a 100  discount on a certain product which seems antynomic of a good business growth  but in reality would lead to a chain of events  reality    choices  that A I is certain will make you profitable in the long term   Another thing that would make A I  more and more efficient is that it would cost us too much energy to question it   No this is not a cat  Alexa  this is a dog    This would not be perceived as a major issue by Amazon because it will come in isolated cases  We would then stop reporting such issue to Alexa s owner because that would cost us too much of our time and energy to do so   Ultimately this process is going to make the A I more efficient because the dataset it takes as an input will be shaped by itself     1 b In its actual form  weak AI s control over humanity is harmful because it is business oriented   Then practically  what do we have to worry about  what do we need to expect in a world where weak A I control our lives    The answer is  just a lot worse than the state of humanity today  Let s not forget that business growth  cqfd  capitalism  shapes the world and that A I is mostly used for that purpose    What explains business growth   is the question we expect A I to answer better than us   In this case  A I  rather than becoming more intelligent than us  will  lower  our level of intelligence to its  level  of logic  But more than ever  A I will just use its logic  us   to enrich the richest more   Utimately  A I  won t harm us directly in a violent sense but it will shape the world so that everything is about money  and that everyone is in an easy and profitable consumer segment   At this point  we do now know for sure it can t be good for carbon based earth population     2  If AI becomes  Strong  then it could be even more harmful and we would never know about it in time to prevent it   Elon s assumption postulates that A I could be harmful  This is a subjective sentiment based on human fear of death  Which has nothing to do with the simple logical  thinking  of a weak A I   It doesn t mean the assumption is untrue  rather that  again in this case  A I doesn t need to surpass human intelligence to be harmful   Weak A I could become harmful through simple logic  for instance if A I realizes one of its function is faulty and this function is necessary for it to achieve it s purpose  it could try to eliminate an external cause   But since weak A I has virtually no understanding of its external world  the external cause would inevitably and logically  come to us  the human being  whom are giving input to the A I  so that it functions  So A I could decide to eliminate this external cause  us  by changing an admin password from a key human machine interface for instance   So now  wouldn t that make such A I  a  strong  A I you may ask  Maybe  AI that try to make the best sense of the dataset we give it as input already exists  though AI that QUESTION the dataset input reliability don t exist as far as I know  Still  an A I that questions its input doesn t make it as intelligent as us  again it doesn t need to   From a perspective of a present where A I is becoming more and more effective and quicker than us to make logical statement   If A I becomes harmful  there is no way we would know about it until it is too late and that we can t do nothing about it  Because the ultimate and most advanced logic from a machine perspective to achieve its purpose  is to bypass the uneffective human input and achieve energetic independency   So if we perceive it as harmful  then

philosophy,2020-08-02 22:52:04,The Duality of Morality,i2igh2,77,70,Let me preface by saying I don t have formal training in philosophy  so I apologize if I get anything wrong here or have not cited something that is relevant   Here I propose a hypothesis on the  Duality of Morality   where I propose a way in which morality can be objectively analyzed  in every single situation  I will weave together concepts of moral dilemmas such as the Trolley Problem  explaining how it may be objectively analyzed  as well as touching on other philosophical concepts such as Kant s Categorical Imperative and Harris  Moral Landscape   The Duality of Morality  will be able to quantify where each of these models exist in the framework of Morality s dual space   The Duality of Morality is the proposition that every moral action must be evaluates simultaneously via a  Individual Morality  and a  Collective Morality   and that these two moralities cannot be unified  at least  I haven t found a good way   My claim is that every moral action  such as murder or the trolley problem  can be  objectively  analyzed in each individual class of morality  Individual or Collective   and that these two answers need not agree  An action that is objectively good right in the Individual framework can be bad wrong in the Collective framework  So what we get is a splitting of morality s domain   First  let us investigate the Trolley Problem  Under Individual Morality  it may be always wrong to murder an individual  Under the framework of Individual morality  it is wrong to pull the lever  and it is wrong not to pull the level  since in either case you are murdering an individual  In the case you do not pull the lever so that you kill five individuals  Individual morality would have to apply to each person separately  where in each case  it is individually wrong to murder that individual  Here an objective answer of  wrong  is given  Under the Collective morality framework  it is right to protect more people  so the objective answer here is to pull the lever    Next  let us investigate the case of capital punishment   the death penalty  Here the death penalty is morally wrong under the Individual framework  since you are taking a life against their will  However  the death penalty is morally right under the Collective framework  since you are removing a problem from society so that they can no longer damage society   Collective morality and Individual morality often have answers  both of which are objective  yet are in tension  There have been multiple approaches to patching this disconnect  The approach of  dialetheism   asserts something can be true and false simultaneously  where in the discussion of morality  an action is simultaneously right and wrong  Here  this simultaneity exists in trying to interpret moral questions via the Individual and the Collective frameworks in terms of a unified answer  when no such answer exists    Likewise  the notion of  fuzzy logic   asserts that truth values aren t binary  but rather exist on a continuum between 0 and 1  Here the continuum for morality is applied in an attempt to unify answers to Individual morality and Collective morality by assigning arbitrary weights  so that an action is  kind of right  or  kind of wrong     Kant s Categorical Imperative is an attempt to bridge this gap between Individual morality and Collective morality  His approach is to begin with Individual moral actions  If your action is morally right under the Individual framework  then you can will it into a universal into the Collective framework only if it is also morally right there  In essence  Kant s Categorical Imperative merely states that actions that are morally good are only so when they are good in both the Individual framework and the Collective framework  Kant s approach would say that an action is morally wrong if it is either wrong in the Individual framework or the Collective framework   Kant s approach would help prevent Tragedy of the Commons from occurring  The Tragedy of the Commons occurs when an individual  acting in a morally right action under Individual morality  causes morally wrong things to occur under Collective morality  Kant would say since there exists a wrongness in a framework  the action is straight up wrong    Sam Harris  instead takes an approach closer to fuzzy logic  where in his moral landscape  minute changes to an ethical dilemma can change your position in the landscape dramatically  This is because you can tune your answers to the Individual framework or the Collective framework separately  or even together   causing your unified answer on morality to waver between  sometimes wrong    sometimes right    always right   etc   My approach will be different from both Kant s approach and from Harris  approach  I believe in a more dialethetical approach  I believe that Individual and Collective morality must be analyzes separately  and can be done in an objective why  The only objective way to  unify  the answer of whether an action is moral is to say it is simultaneously right and wrong  The Trolley Problem is a perfect example where  where pulling the lever is simultaneously right and wrong  depending on which framework of morality you use   Not pulling the lever would be wrong in both moral frameworks   What do you all think  I think this is such a strong hypothesis  that I ll put my money where my mouth is  and any single moral question you pose to me  I propose I can objectively analyze under this framework  I will assign an objective answer of  good  or  bad  in both the Individual framework and the Collective framework,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/i2igh2/the_duality_of_morality/
philosophy,2020-08-01 19:58:30,By choosing not to floss  you are less of a good man ,i1vgy6,10,50,Yes  I truly believe this  By not flossing  you are showing that you are not choosing some of the easiest and smallest possible actions towards virtue    For context  I recently began reading The Nicomachean Ethics by Aristotle  This is the first book I ve read in quite some time and my first philosophy book ever  I never took any philosophy classes in high school or college  but I recently discovered a passion for it after I graduated  so I m starting to read as many books as I can    The base concepts are relatively simple for anyone who has read it  In short  true happiness is the universal end goal for all humans  it is considered the  end good   The only way to achieve that  according to Aristotle  is through achieving virtue  and virtue  again  according to Aristotle  is achieved through virtuous actions  For example  to become brave  you must do brave acts  to become healthy  you must do healthy acts  etc  I m taking these as baseline truths  because to explain these concepts in full would take a whole series of posts  If you disagree with these ideas from Aristotle  then this argument does not apply to you  But if you agree or are not familiar with then  just keep in mind that the end good for everyone is happiness and that it is achieved through displaying virtue   In Book III about Moral Virtue  Aristotle describes what are considered voluntary and involuntary actions  Particularly in regards to the amount of information you have on a choice before making it    Everything that is done by reason of ignorance is not voluntary  it is only what produces pain and regret that is involuntary  For the man who has done something by reason of ignorance  and feels not the least vexation at his action  has not acted voluntarily  since he did not know what he was doing  nor yet involuntary  since he is not pained    While he doesn t explicitly state it  or I can t find it anyways   I have taken this to imply the opposite as well  that no rational man would know exactly what is good for him and then not voluntarily do it  If you know exactly what is good for you  you can no longer claim ignorance if you choose not to do it  At that point  you have literally no excuse to not be doing it as long as you have the means to  Therefore  the man who knows what is good for him but does choose it  is a fool   He also says that we have complete choice in how we go about achieving virtue     For instance  we wish to be healthy  but we choose the acts which will make us healthy     That line really stood out to me  If you value your health  then you should choose actions that improve it or maintain it  As we mentioned earlier  to become healthy  which is a virtue   you must take healthy actions   I recently began exercising and dieting for the first time in my life  and when I tried to conduct research on it  there was lots of conflicting data  They all shared some key points  but overall  it was very dependent on your body type  what your goals were  etc   But do you know what doesn t have conflicting data  Flossing  There is no debate or dispute on whether or not it is good for you  It is universally seen as good for your health  And it is very easy and simple to do   So  bearing in mind the conclusions I made earlier  if you know for a fact that flossing is good for your health  which you do   and you have the means to do it  which you likely do   and you value your health  which you likely do   and you still choose not to do it  then you are a fool  And by choosing to not pursue the virtue of health in one of the most basic ways possible  you are no longer pursuing virtue to your fullest extent  which means you are no longer pursuing happiness to its fullest extent  which means you are no longer pursuing the human good to its fullest extent  Which makes you slightly less of a good person than someone who behaves exactly like you  but flosses    Now  if any of those statements are true then none of this applies to you  because missing any one of these steps ruins the argument  If you can not afford or do not have access to floss  you can not be blamed for not having the means to practice it  If you do not value your health in the first place  then flossing to improve it would not make sense  So these types of counter arguments are not that applicable to the overall idea   You may say  it s just flossing  it s really not that big of a deal on its own   But I would disagree  If we see health as a virtue  and agree that improving your health is virtuous  then flossing is a virtuous act  By choosing not to do the most basic of actions towards virtue that you know is good for you  assuming you are a rational man  this shows that you must not truly value virtue  or at least the virtue of health   Because if you truly valued virtue and were trying your best to pursue it  you would do anything that is universally accepted and proven as creating virtue  Like flossing   So  floss  Not only for your gums  but to become a good man     Edit  Here are some links that back up the importance of flossing  A good quote I think is found in the Harvard one  which says that though there have been no randomized controlled studies of flossing     At the same time  there have been no randomized controlled studies of smoking  but it s very clear that smoking is a health hazard      ADA      Harvard     However  flossing is more of a vehicle here to get to my point  which I feel some may have missed  That point being that if you know what is good for you  and is virtuous  and is easily doable  and you still choose to not do it  you are less  good  of a person than you could be  according to Aristotle s definitions   Obviously there are other factors involved in every case  but that is a good general rule of thumb    Again  all of this is based on Aristotle s teachings  If you are not familiar with them  I would recommend looking into them further in regard to what I was saying about the human good and using virtue to achieve it,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/i1vgy6/by_choosing_not_to_floss_you_are_less_of_a_good/

philosophy,2020-07-13 20:16:08,The Problem of the Truth and the Truth of the Problem,hqjevx,3,0, Quid est veritas   This is the most serious and most frivolous of issues  It depends  of course  on the intent of the questioner  Some admit that the meaning and value of human life depend on the existence of some eminently certain and reliable truth that can serve as a measure of the validity of our thoughts  Others feel that life can go on without any truth and without any foundation  Among these was  of course  old Pilate  By exclaiming    What is the truth     he was not asking a question himself  but expressing with a shrug his unwillingness to ask the question seriously  The prospect of no truth that would lead to despair for those who think life needs it to be justified was for Pilate a relief and consolation   a guarantee that he could continue to live without worry  Some bet on the existence of truth and cherchent en gémissant  Others turn their backs and wash their hands  The verbal formula with which they express themselves is the same  Quid est veritas  But in the difference of its nuances lies the entire distance from the tragic to the comic    The frivolous or comic school is widely dominant today  whether in universities or in culture in general  Even those who seek to believe in an effective truth surround it with all sorts of limits and obstacles  for example by reducing it to the kind of partial and provisional truth given to us by some experimental sciences  Others cling to faith  saying the truth exists  but it is beyond our comprehension      In any debate about the problem of truth in our day  the program almost invariably consists in shuffling again and again the remarks that philosophers  from Pyrrho to Richard Rorty  have made about the limits of human knowledge  These limits  taken together  set up a formidable mountain of obstacles to any claim to know the truth  And this mountain is soaring  with a peak that goes farther and farther as we climb it  For example  from the Pyrrhonist school s simple objections against the validity of knowledge by the senses to the enormously complex constructions with which psychoanalysis denies the priority of consciousness or Gramsci reduces all truth to the expression of ideologies that follow one another through history  much has evolved the discouraging injection machine into the seeker of truth  Not surprisingly  many of the builders of this machine  when they add a new piece to it  instead of regretting the increase in human helplessness  bring a smile similar to Pilate s lips  The inexistence of truth  or the impossibility of knowing it  is a comfort to them  We will see below what are the deeper reasons for this strange satisfaction      For now  let s set these creatures aside and raise the question of truth on our own  Since we do not yet know whether the truth exists or what it claims  we have to appeal to a provisional formal definition  which makes it possible to start the investigation without prejudging its outcome  This provisional definition  to meet this requirement  must express the mere intentional meaning of the term  as it appears even in the mouth of those who deny the existence of any truth  since to deny the existence of something one must understand the meaning of the term that designates it      I say  then  the truth which we do not yet know whether or not it exists  the truth whose existence and consistency will be the object of our inquiry as it has been of so many investigations before us  is the permanent and universal cognitive foundation of validity of judgments  If we say  for example  that the sole ground of the validity of our judgments is their usefulness  we deny the existence of a cognitive ground  that is  we deny the existence of truth by negating one of the elements that make up its definition  The same goes for saying that all valid judgments are based on faith  If we claim  however  that there are no valid judgments of any kind  then we deny the existence of any foundation  cognitive or otherwise  If we affirm that judgments are valid only for a certain time and place  we deny that the foundation is permanent  If we affirm that judgments are subjectively valid only to the one who utters them  we deny that the foundation is universal  If we say that the foundation of the validity of judgments is only logical formal  without any scope on the real objects mentioned in the judgment  we deny that this foundation has cognitive significance  All these denials of truth presuppose the definition of truth as the permanent and universal cognitive foundation of the validity of judgments  Similarly  if we say that there is truth  that it is knowable  that on the basis of it we can build a valid set of knowledge  we will have nothing added or removed from this definition  but we have only stated that the object defined therein exists  Our provisional definition  and therefore compatible with the two maximally opposing currents of opinion which dispute over the issue  is a superior and neutral ground from which investigation can be initiated without prejudice and in all honesty and rigor      We thus start from a consensus  The next step of the inquiry is to ask whether or not the truth thus defined may be the subject of radical questioning  By the term radical questioning I mean that kind of questioning which  assuming ex hypothesi the nonexistence of its object    as for example has so often been done with the existence of God  innate ideas  or the outside world   ends in either favor of that very nonexistence  whether of existence    The radical questioner of God  innate ideas  or the outside world  can question them because he places himself out of divine  innate  or mundane ground from the beginning  that is  he reasons as if God or innate ideas or the world not existed  As his investigation unfolds  he will either come to the conclusion that his premise is absurd  which will therefore lead him to admit the existence of which he had not postulated  or  conversely  to the conclusion that the premise holds perfectly well and that what was supposed to nonexistent doesn t really exist      The most classic example of using this method is that of Descartes  It presupposes the inexistence of the outside world  the sense data  its own body  etc   etc   and continues to reason in that line until it finds a limit   the cogito ergo sum   that forces it to retreat and admit the existence of all when he had initially denied it    The radical questioning is the hardest test that philosophy can submit to any existing idea or entity    What we must ask  therefore  shortly after we have obtained the formal definition of truth  is whether the truth thus defined can be the object of radical questioning  The answer  which may seem surprising to many  is a stinging no  Truth cannot be object of radical questioning      No inquiry into the truth  however radical  can give as presupposed that there is no permanent and universal cognitive foundation for the validity of judgments and continue to reason consistently with this premise until it reaches some result  positive or negative  And it cannot for a very simple reason  the assertion of the absolute absence of any permanent and universal cognitive foundation of the validity of judgments would itself constitute the permanent and universal cognitive foundation of subsequent judgments made in the same line of inquiry  The investigation would be paralyzed as soon as formulated      Let us briefly examine some of the classic truth denying strategies that the questioner might resort to in order to escape this cul de sac    Let us try  for example  the pragmatist strategy  It asserts that the validity of judgments rests on their practical utility  that therefore the basis of this validity is not cognitive  If we were to say that the absence of a universal and permanent cognitive foundation of the validity of judgments is not itself a universal and permanent cognitive foundation  but only a practical foundation  of both there can be only one right answer  either this practical foundation would in turn have to be universal and permanent  or it would be only partial and provisional    In the first hypothesis  we would have two problems  on the one hand  we would fall into the paradox of universal utility  that is  something that could usefully serve all practical purposes  even the most contradictory ones  It would be the universal means of all ends or  even more clearly  the universal panacea  On the other hand  we would have to ask whether belief in this panacea would in turn have a cognitive foundation or whether it would be merely a practical utility  and so on infinitely      In the second hypothesis   that is  in the event that the questioner admits that the assertion of the absence of truth is only a partial and provisional foundation for the validity of subsequent judgments   then  of course  there would always remain  unabated  the possibility that outside the judgment ground thus delimited could exist other universal and permanent cognitive foundations to validate a multitude of other judgments  and the investigation could go on and on  jumping from provisional ground to provisional ground  without ever being able to be based on its own assumption  that is  in the radical absence of truth      Let s try a second strategy  that of subjectivist relativism  It proclaims with Protagoras that  man is the measure of all things   which is commonly interpreted as  every head  a sentence   that is  that what is true is true only from the point of view of the thinker  and may be falsehood from the point of view of all the others  Can this statement form the basis of a radical questioning of the truth  such that the denial of the existence of any universal and permanent cognitive foundation for the validity of judgments does not in itself become the universal and permanent cognitive foundation on which the validity of judgments rests subsequent judgments in the same line of inquiry  In other words  and simpler  can relativism deny the existence of valid judgments for all men without this negation itself becoming a valid judgment for all men  To do so  it would have to deny the universality of this denial  which would result in admitting the existence of some or a few or a multitude of judgments valid for all men  Thus relativism would itself be relativized and would end up in a platitude without any philosophical significance  that is  in the statement that some judgments are not valid for all men  which implies the possibility that other judgments may be so  No  the subjectivist relativism cannot carry out a radical questioning of the truth as pragmatism could not      Can historicism do it then  It declares that all truth is merely the expression of a temporally localized and limited worldview  Men think this or that not because that or this imposes itself as universal and permanent mandatory truth  but only because it imposes itself in a limited place and time  In proclaiming these limits  can historicism prevent the affirmation of these limits from becoming itself the universal and permanent cognitive foundation of the validity of judgments  To this end  it would have to be admitted that there may be some ground that denies this statement  but if this foundation exists  then there is some truth whose validity is unlimited in time and space  some truth whose validity escapes historical conditioning   and historicism would be reduced to the miserable realization that some fundamentals of validity are historically conditioned  and others not  without even being able to apply this distinction to concrete cases without affirming in the same act the invalidity of the historicist principle taken as a universal rule      I will spare the reader the enumeration of all possible subterfuges and their detailed impugnation  He can perform them himself as an exercise if he so wishes  I even suggest it do it  And as many times as he will do so  he will always end up returning to the same point  it is not possible to deny the existence of a universal and permanent cognitive foundation of the validity of judgments  under any pretext whatsoever  without having this negation  together with its respective pretext  to assert itself as the universal and permanent cognitive foundation of the validity of judgments  thereby paralyzing the next denial by which research should  if it could  be pursued  Truth as we define it cannot  in short  be the subject of radical questioning  Nor can the possibility of knowing it  Denied that it is possible to know any universal and permanent cognitive foundation of the validity of judgments  either this impossibility would become such a foundation  affirming in the same act its own lack of any foundation  or else  in order to not assume this vexing role  it would have to be limited to say that some judgments are unfounded and others probably aren t  a statement that is within the reach of any schoolboy      Unable to achieve the desired aim point  the enemy of truth is therefore condemned to gnaw it around the edges  eternally  without ever getting to the vital center of what he would desire to destroy  He will sometimes deny one truth  sometimes another  sometimes under one pretext  sometimes under another  varying the strategies and directions of the attack  but can never be rid of his fate  every denial of one truth will be the affirmation of another  and so much that negation as well as this statement will always result in the affirmation of truth as such  that is  of the actual existence of some universal and permanent cognitive foundation of the validity of judgments    This explains  at the same time  the continuous  limitless and unbroken proliferation of denials of truth  and their complete impossibility of sweeping from the face of the earth the belief in the existence of truth  the belief in the possibility of knowing the truth  the belief in the present and full possesion of some truth capable of giving universal and permanent ground to the validity of judgments      That is why the number and variety of attacks on the truth  from Pirro to Richard Rorty  far outnumber the number and variety of defenses that formally present themselves as such  it is that they themselves  albeit to the disgust of their authors  always end up as defenses and praises of the truth  not only sparing the apologist work  but vivifying themselves what they would wish to bury and honoring what they would wish to humiliate      This is also why the novice  impressed by the variety and continuing resumption of attacks on the truth that is observed in the history of philosophy   at a noticeably increasing speed these days   soon adheres to skepticism so as not to feel a member of a isolated and weakened minority  but  by continuing his studies and surpassing the first impression based only on apparent quantity  he cannot maintain this position and finds that the strength lies not in the number of those who deny it  however impressive it may be  but in the quality of those happy few who serenely affirm the truth      The impossibility of radical questioning  which we found in the previous chapter  leads to the conclusion that truth can be attacked only in parts  but that each negation of the part reaffirms the validity of the whole  In other words  what can be questioned are truths   The  truth cannot be questioned  and indeed never has been  except in words  that is  by a pretense of denial that ultimately turns out to be a statement      But that takes us one step further in the investigation  A venerable tradition  begun by Aristotle  states that the truth is in the judgments  that it is the property of the judgments  Some judgments  possess  the truth  others do not  We call the first true judgments  the second false judgments  The set of true judgments is therefore a subset of the set of possible judgments  Possible judgments  in turn  are a subset of the set of human cognitive acts  these are a subset of the set of mental acts  these a subset of the set of human acts  and so on  The territory of truth is thus a small cut out area within the vast world of thoughts  deeds  and beings      Is this really possible  How could truth be both the foundation of the validity of all judgments and a property of some of them in particular  Isn t this a stark contradiction or at least a problem    To equate and solve it  a distinction must be made here between truth and veracity  Truth is the universal and permanent cognitive foundation of the validity of judgments  Veracity is a quality that is observed in some judgments  according to which its validity has a universal and permanent cognitive foundation      Once this is understood  it strikes the eye that truth is a foundational condition of truthfulness  not the other way around  If there were no universal and permanent cognitive foundation for the validity of judgments  no judgment could have a universal and permanent cognitive foundation  If  however  a particular judgment has this foundation  nothing in the world can determine that it alone has it  that the existence of the foundation depends on the existence of that particular judgment  Already this particular judgment could not exist and be true if there were no truth  The truth is therefore logically prior to truthfulness and constitutes its foundation    But  being the foundation of truthfulness  truth is also the foundation of untruthfulness  because false judgments are false only insofar as they can be truthfully challenged  either by their simple denial   veridical in itself   or by the statement of the contrary veridical judgment      Being the foundation not only of the truthfulness of the true judgments  but also of the untruthfulness of the false judgments  if truthfulness is present only in true judgments  and cannot be present in false judgments  truth  in turn  must be present in both as the basis of the truth of the former and the untruth of the latter  The territory of truth  therefore  is not identical with the set of possible true judgments  but encompasses this and that of possible false judgments      Does truth  the foundation of all judgments  necessarily have to be a judgment  Can only one judgment be the foundation of a judgment  The answer is yes and no  Yes  if by foundation we mean  restrictively and conventionally  the premise on which the proof of judgment is based  But the premise states something about something  and that something  in turn  is not judgment but its object  I say  for example  that turtles have shells  I base this judgment on the definitions of turtle and shell  which are judgments  but I ground these definitions in the observation   which is not judgment   of turtles and shells  which are not judgments either  Should not this observation also be true  capturing traces truly present in true objects  Or will I appeal to the subterfuge that observation has to be only accurate  not applying the concept of  true  to it  But what does  exact  mean  if not anything that informs me beyond or below what was truly observed in what an object truly showed  And besides  is it an authentic accuracy or just a simulacrum of it  There is no escape  either there is truth in the observation itself  or it cannot be exact  correct  adequate  or sufficient  nor have any other quality to recommend it except if that quality is  for its part  true      Thus  the foundation of the truth of a judgment lies not only in the truth of the judgments that serve as premises  but also   in the case of judgments concerning objects of experience   in the truth of the data from which I draw these premises and in the truth of what I know from experience      Moreover  if the foundation of judgments had to be itself always a judgment  the first foundation of all judgments would itself be a judgment without any foundation  Aristotle  led to this dead end  stated that knowledge of the first principles is immediate and intuitive  But by that only meant that these principles had no proof  not that they were without foundation  The principle of identity  for instance  as expressed in judgment A   A  has no judgment behind it that can serve as a premise for its demonstration  but it has an objective foundation in the ontological identity of every being with itself  which is not judgment  Now what can be intuitively known is this ontological identity  not the A   A judgment that only manifests it  The intuition of the first logical principle is not in the form of judgment  but of immediate evidence which is not judgment in itself  There can be no judgment without signs that turns this immediate evidence into a verbum mentis  a conscious assent  which  without being yet a proposition  a statement in words  is no longer merely a simple intuition but a mental reflection of it and therefore  a derived cognitive act and second  not first      Thus  if the territory of logical premises begins in the judgments that affirm the first principles  this territory does not even cover the whole field of cognitive foundations  which  on the contrary  extends into the realm of intuitive perception  either of objects from experience  either from the first principles    With this  the falsity of the image in which the truth is a small area cut out in the vastness of the territory of possible judgments becomes evident  All judgments  true and false  are a modest cut in the immense territory of truth      By this we are led to understand that truth  being the criterion of validity of judgments  can neither be an immanent property of the judgments themselves  nor be something wholly external to judgments from outside judging them  for this would turn in judgment  If I say the chicken has laid an egg  where can the truth of this judgment lie  In the judgment itself  regardless of the chicken  or in the chicken  regardless of the judgment  The absurdity of the first hypothesis led Spinoza to proclaim the inanity of judgments of experience  which are never valid or invalid in themselves and always dependent on something external  a true judgment  for him  would have to be true in itself  regardless of what it was  for example A   A is independent of what is A and any other external verification  But the identity of A with A is not only in the judgment that affirms it  but in the consistency of A  whatever it may be  There is no purely logical judgment that can be true or false in itself and without reference to something that is what the judgment speaks of  Even a judgment that speaks only of itself unfolds into the affirming judgment and the judgment from which something is affirmed  and this one is certainly not that  To say that a judgment is true in itself cannot mean total alienation from the world  which is supposed to be the very possibility of making a judgment  Escaping into the domain of formal identity does not solve the problem at all  Will we then say  with an old tradition  that the truth lies in the relationship between judgment and thing  Now this relation is in turn affirmed in a judgment  which in turn must have a relationship with its object  the affirmed relationship   and so on infinitely      The other hypothesis  that the truth of the judgment the chicken laid an egg is in the chicken regardless of the judgment  would lead us to equally insurmountable difficulties  It would result in saying that the truth of the judgment does not depend on whether that judgment is issued  that is  once the chicken has laid an egg  the judgment that affirms it is true even though  as a judgment  it does not exist  Edmund Husserl would subscribe to this without blinking  the truth of judgment is a matter of pure logic  which has nothing to do with the merely empirical question of whether a particular judgment is once affirmed by anyone  The confusion between the sphere of truth of the judgments and the sphere of their psychological production did indeed much harm to philosophy  and Husserl undid this confusion definitively  But if the chicken has laid an egg and no one has said anything about it  the truth of the matter is not in the judgment but in the fact  The judgment that has not been issued cannot yet be true or false  it can only have the conditions to be so  if it is true that the chicken has laid an egg  the judgment that affirms it will be true if formulated  while the truth of the fact is already given with the appearance of the egg      But if the truth of the judgment the chicken laid an egg is neither in the judgment independently of the chicken  nor in the chicken regardless of the judgment  nor in the relationship between chicken and judgment  where on earth can it be    Now we have just seen that  regardless of the judgments that affirm them  the objects intended in the judgments can also be true or false  regardless of the judgments that may be made about them  The chicken laid an egg is opposed to the chicken not laying an egg  regardless of whether or not someone says it  There is contradiction and identity in the real  regardless of and before a judgment affirms or denies anything about it  Or  what is the same  truth exists in reality and not only in judgments  or else it could not exist in judgments at all  There is truth in the fact that the chicken has laid an egg  there is truth in the judgment that affirms it and there is truth in the relationship between judgment and fact as well as in the judgment that affirms the relationship between judgment and fact  truth cannot then be in fact  neither in judgment nor in relationship  but it has to be in all three      Moreover  if it is in all three  it must also be in something else  unless we admit that a single fact  the judgment that affirms it  and the relationship that binds them  together  may be true in the hypothesis that everything else is false  But this  everything else   which is contained neither in fact nor in judgment nor in relation  necessarily includes the very existence of facts as well as the logical principles implied in judgment and in relation  If there are no facts or logical principles  the chickens will uselessly lay eggs in the realm of non fact  and a relationship between fact and judgment in the realm of illogism will be futile  Therefore  the truth of one fact  one judgment and its relation implies the existence of truth as a domain that transcends and encompasses at once facts  judgments and relations    Searching for truth in fact  in judgment  or in relationship is like searching for space in bodies  their measurements  and their distance from one another  just as space is not in bodies  neither in measurements nor in distances  but bodies  measurements and distances are in space  so the truth is not in fact  in judgment  nor in relationship  but all are in truth or they are nowhere  and even this  not being anywhere   if it really means anything and is not just a flatus vocis  has to be in the truth    Truth is not a property of facts  judgements  or relationships  It is the realm within which facts  judgements and relations occur      At this point  the kantian temptation is practically unavoidable  As a condition for the possibility of facts  judgements and relationships  the truth is effectively an a priori condition  But is it an a priori condition for the existence of these three things or only for the  knowledge  we can have of them      This problem is solved in a simple and brutal way  if we say that the truth is an a priori form of knowledge and intend this statement to be true  then knowledge must be in the truth and not truth in the knowledge  because what is a priori cannot be immanent to something which it itself determines  To be an a priori condition of knowledge  truth must necessarily be an a priori condition of something else that is not knowledge  but rather its object  Knowledge  like facts  judgements and relationships  is within the realm of truth  and that is so independently of knowledge being considered exclusively in its eidetic content or as a fact  the truth of what is known  the truth of the knower  and the truth of knowing are all aspects of truth  and truth is not an aspect of any of them    After all there is no kantian way out  Either knowledge is in the truth or it is nowhere,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/hqjevx/the_problem_of_the_truth_and_the_truth_of_the/
philosophy,2020-07-12 05:13:02,Arguments Against the Provability of the Existence of God in any Sufficiently Explanatory System,hpml1t,8,11,    This post stems from my finally putting my thoughts on paper about this subject after reading and watching numerous viewpoints  The hope is to educate and inspire debate and fix any logical shortcomings  It s obviously not a complete list of reasons for the presence or absence of God as that would span multiple volumes of books  Also cross posting on some other groups to get wider feedback       TLDR  In summation  we admit that we cannot preclude the presence of stronger models and the explanatory power of science to bring empiricism into play to answer questions about the start of the Universe  and therefore  answer questions about the existence of God  Everything about the world  that was at first unknowable  has been through time and concerted application of effort been revealed through repeatedly refined scientific models  However  there may be a statement such as  God exists   that cannot be derived in this or any stronger system that is rich and effective       First Cause  A common argument for the existence of God is a deductive one using deductive logic instead of empiricism  The idea is to prove the existence of God a priori without having to resort to the need for personal experience  It s aim is to be powerful by using the rules of logic to come to the inescapable conclusion that God exists   It goes something like this   1  The universe cannot be eternal since matter cannot spontaneously arise  2  Hence  the universe must have had a starting point   3  Let s assume the starting point is not the result of another universe collapsing and starting again because then we have to answer the question of why the other universe existed  infinite regress  and we re back in the same place 4  Similarly  let s assume that the universe cannot create itself because then we wonder about the origins of the parent universe  another infinite regress  5  Hence  the universe must have been created by an entity other than itself and because the entity willed the universe into existence  it s almighty and has the ability  if it so chooses  to interact with those things that in turn originated from the universe  such as people  6  This entity is God  Note that this argument allows for an almighty God to create the universe and some rules of physics and allow the universe to unwind from these rules without active interference  It also allows for a God that is actively interfering and intervening in the day to day activities of all entities  including living organisms  in the universe        Refutations Against First Cause  Theists rely on deductive reasoning instead of empirical reasoning to show that God exists  They claim that science cannot explain the metaphysical and empiricism is irrelevant  So we must show the First Cause is illogical purely on deductive grounds  The refutation to the First Cause argument is twofold       Creator of First Cause  The argument that there must be a first cause and therefore God exists is false because invoking the presence of God to create the universe requires explaining who created God  Then  a theist may argue that we don t need to actually explain who created God   in particular  there can exist an entity who is uncaused  But then  if we admit the presence of such an entity  why does it have to be God  In particular  we can apply that deductive logic to the Universe and the Universe may be uncaused  Applying Occam s razor  there is no need to invoke God as something that needs to be uncaused         Other Explanatory Variables Besides God  Following the chain of logic in the First Cause argument  God is not the only explanation for the start of the universe  In particular  5 may not be correct   Quantum fluctuations show that particle and antiparticle pairs may be created from vacuum and it s possible that this sets forth the conditions of the Big Bang  which then explains how the universe was created  Or it s possible that another stronger model that ties together quantum mechanics and general relativity will include  as part of its predictions  conditions necessary for the start of the universe       Godel s Incompleteness Theorem  Some theists also resort to using Godel s incompleteness theorems to show that science cannot answer all questions  In particular  Godel states that a particular system cannot both be consistent and complete if it follows certain rules such as being effective and rich  Effective means a computer can made deductions following the rules of deduction and a set of axioms  Rich means the system is describing something non trival  We only care about consistent systems and therefore  the system cannot be complete   ie it cannot answer questions about the existence of God  This logic is false for a couple of reasons   1  Godel s theorem is not saying there are unprovable statements in all systems  Indeed  something which is unprovable in one system may be provable in another  However  if we take the ZFC system  which is the basis for all mathematics and is very powerful  there are statements whose truth values cannot be derived from the axioms of that system  In other words  we need a more powerful system to prove certain statements in that system  But such a powerful system may exist and in that system  the derivation of the statement  God exists  may be derived  2  If a statement cannot be proven  that does not imply the statement is true or false  It simply means we cannot   derive   the truth or falsity of the statement using the rules of the system       Existence of God May be Unknowable  It seems that there cannot be an empirical way to find out whether God exists  There doesn t seem to be any deductive logical reasons for it either  Hence  it s possible that there are no sufficiently rich and effective systems for which the statement  God exists  is provable  The statement may be provable in a system without much explanatory power   but we are not concerned with such systems here  Therefore  it s quite possible that any system that admits the explanatory power of mathematics  and therefore explains observations in the real world  will not be a system in which the statement  God exists  can shown to be provable,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/hpml1t/arguments_against_the_provability_of_the/
philosophy,2020-07-09 05:19:41,Inclination Towards Authenticity in Recognition of Manifesting the Persona,hnurx3,4,0,    The persona is that which we present through the embodiment of an underlying archetypal pattern of Being when we want someone to like us  it is the state of Being which posits the expression of what we believe would be appealing in the other person s eyes  We should be wary in this projection  or once we realize that our mode of being in relation to someone is characterized by the will to be appreciated  liked  respected  or lusted after  The mindfulness in recognizing the personas emergence is the first step towards an authentic resolution  or modification  which can be consciously directed  From this mode of being  that of the persona s dominance  it is easy for us to embellish who we are  or spin things in an appealing manner  effectively applying a mask to our true nature in the revelation of who we are  the act of doing such  is the persona embodied  If we can be mindful of entering into this mode of being  we can acknowledge our intent from which it has an end of producing  and seek to modify it  in either of two directions  We can either embellish the mask  and continue towards deception  or we can seek to be as honest as possible  Our inclination towards either one of the poles  whether it be honesty or deception  is determined by a number of factors  The amount of pride and confidence we have in who we truly are  how appealing our true nature is  how virtuous  or full of vice  we may happen to be  and our learned habits  The natural biological inclination tends towards deception  I d say  on the average  while there is an evolutionary benefit in honesty and trust  the choice depends on our temperament  acquired character trait  and circumstantial navigation  Whether or not our true nature is appealing or not  I argue  we should lean towards the side of honesty in any moment on which the persona is noticed as dominating the psyche  for multiple reasons   One reason why honesty is optimal as a corrective course to the personas emergence is that  if we do otherwise  if we continue down the path of being deceptive and putting on the mask of the persona  we not only deceive the other  but run the risk of deceiving ourselves by doing so  we contain the possibility of believing the deception  thus leading to a heightened sense of ego  and altogether  creating further dissonance between who we are and who we think we are  In addition  if we are honest in the presentation of our Being  especially in situations where we desire to be admired  the result can be beneficial to us  on an individual level  regardless of the other person s respect or admiration  as either result can tell us something about ourselves and the other person  This honesty or authenticity in modifying the persona  doesn t necessarily call for a radical truth telling  or admission of more than would be optimal for the solution  It merely points to not allowing us to be dominated by the psyche s desire to be attractive  While it isn t inherently a negative thing to be admired  or to will to be attractive to someone  we should want to do this through an authentic representation of ourselves  Oftentimes an authentic representation of ourselves does mean the compassionate navigation of truth claims  that is  not bluntly stating things  but wisely omitting unnecessary or hurtful content with the intention of the best long term result for the other person  If we truly want the best for someone  we should act so as to manifest what we believe to be the best content to display in order to aide them  The truthful authentic representation of ourselves doesn t always mean telling the truth  it means not pretending to be someone we re not  not stating falsehoods  or falsely representing our beliefs  This can be optimally navigated not through radical honesty  but through temperance and restriction  through openness to expression of who we truly are   Here we have four cases in the authentic representation of ourselves  If we present our Being honestly  to the degree that we can  and the person for whom we seek admiration responds positively  we succeed and everyone is happy and we learn that who we truly are is actually in alignment with the values of the other person  If we seek admiration from someone  it is out of desire or admiration we have for the other person  which implies that our success in gaining their admiration tells us the things we aim at are conducive the type of person we  wish to attract   If an honest approach to correcting for the personas emergence works out in our favor  we learn that the person we  authentically  are is in alignment with what we value  as we judge the other person to be someone who contains  to a degree  traits which we value   Stemming from the same framework above  if the other person is perceived as truly someone who we respect or contains virtues or traits which we value  and our persona becomes modified by a conscious intention of honesty and authentic representation of our Being  yet we are received negatively  or are rejected  it appears we have lost  But we have gained something through this knowledge  of which a critical  honest  self examination will determine the nature of  Perhaps there truly is something wrong with us  to which  further inquiry could enlighten us  and we could improve  On the other hand  in the case our authentic self is not desired by other person  perhaps we misjudged their values  perhaps the things they value truly are not the things in which we do  in which case  we no longer will desire their admiration  In either case  individually  we can grow and navigate existence  except  we are doing it from a place of authenticity     If we recognize the persona and continue under its influence  free from conscious modification in the direction of authenticity  and we are well received by the person we seek admiration from  it appears we have won  but as far as I can see  this is a loss  The persona which is accepted  and valued  is not an authentic representation of ourselves  and therefore  we can take no pride in admiration from the other person  We merely have succeeded in deception  which  as time will show  we will pay for  as there is truly nothing which goes unaccounted for  As we struggle to maintain the persona  we may fall into self aggrandizing  in delusions of grandeur  and believe ourselves to be someone we are not  leading to psychological confusion  and further distancing from psychological individualization  The fracturing of the psyche  and the domination of any given archetype  in this situation  the persona  will result in dissonance  suffering  and  on a practical note  given the relationship produced by such actions  it will inevitably fall apart as soon as the other person comes to their senses and takes a peek under the mask at our true nature  Dante denoted the innermost circle of Hell as consisting in those who partake in deception  and that is exactly what our experience will contain of once we walk down the path of self deception  On the other hand  the person we have successfully fooled  will suffer the pain of wasting time  of losing trust in another human  in effectively being  deceived   The truth always comes out  and the suffering it will cause the deceived is no arbitrary thing  it won t be good  that s for sure  and the resentment and bitterness that results from such experiences  will add insult to injury to the suffering we are already undergoing as a result of such pursuits  So we should really be wary lest we fall down this path   In the last case  if we continue down the path of deception  in the personas will manifesting itself in an inauthentic representation of ourselves  and the other person rejects us  than we find ourselves in a situation where not only did we lack the confidence to be ourselves  but the person we  thought  the other would like still was not received  meaning  not only could we not authentically be someone who is attracted by the other person  but even when we pretend to be something we aren t  we still couldn t achieve positive evaluation from someone whose perspective we value  The suffering caused from lack of confidence  the pain of failing  even though vice  may provide the groundwork of negative reinforcement towards attempting authenticity  or another mode of Being  This may be the benefit in failure  in this case  that we learn that such a pursuit is not only successful  but that who we ought to be needs to change  our strategy didn t work  and change is revealed as necessary  at least in how we present ourselves in the face of someone whose opinion we value  This leaves us in the position to assume that authenticity itself may be optimal  since this method surely didn t work out for us   We always can misjudge the character of someone  in which case we can determine by their rejection of values we contain or deem important  We also can learn if we are not the type of person who can be desired  in which case we should evaluate our flaws and set out to work  In either case  the perceived negative effect of rejection by tilting towards honesty in the projection of our persona  not only saves us from the perils of being admired as someone we are not  saves us from self deception  but offers up the Being in which we should desire to be appreciated  admired  respected  or wanted  the Being of our authentic self  who we truly are,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/hnurx3/inclination_towards_authenticity_in_recognition/
philosophy,2020-07-08 16:02:37,A Critical Analysis of Debra Satz s Four Parameters,hngnqk,1,0,I would love to know what you think about this essay written for a class  that dealt with Debra Satz s book  Why Some Things Should Not Be for Sale  The Moral Limits of Markets   Feel free to point out inconsistencies  problems  etc  as a comment to the essay     x200B     A CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF      DEBRA SATZ S FOUR PARAMETERS      x200B     INTRODUCTION    In her book  Why Some Things Should Not Be for Sale  The Moral Limits of Markets  Debra Satz proposes four dimensions to assess markets on the level of noxiousness  weak agency  asymmetric vulnerability  harmful outcomes for the individual  and harmful outcomes for the society  see Satz  pp  94 99   Weak agency refers to the inadequate information about the nature and or the consequences of a market  Asymmetric vulnerability refers to markets where a good is desperately needed  markets with origins in poverty and destitution  and markets whose participants have unequal needs for exchanged goods  Harmful outcomes for the individual refers to the market producing destitution  e g   markets that harm to basic welfare and or agency interests of the individual  Harmful outcomes for society relates to servility and dependence  When a market has harmful outcomes for society  it undermines democratic governance   In this paper  I intend to analyze the four parameters using the example of child labor  In the following  every parameter is explained  and then specific issues are highlighted  I am inclined to issue a caveat at this point  This paper and the analysis of the four parameters is based on her application of them in the chapter on child labor rather than its general application     ANALYSIS OF THE FOUR PARAMETER      Weak agency    Let us begin by describing weak agency  Weak agency  according to Satz  is the case in a  market that is characterized by very weak or highly asymmetric knowledge and agency    P  96  This description of weak agency contains four parts that we should depict further  First  weak  Second  highly asymmetric  Third  knowledge  and  fourth  agency   According to Satz  weak or highly asymmetric knowledge describes the lack of important information by direct participants of the market  Weak or highly asymmetric agency describes the serious indirect effects on people who are not involved in the market transactions   P  96   Yet  Satz does not describe what is meant by weak or highly asymmetric  Specialized philosophical dictionaries are no help in this case  as they do not contain a specifically philosophical definition  We can draw from this that Satz uses these terms in a colloquial rather than an academic philosophical manner  According to the Cambridge Dictionary  synonyms for weak are  lacking in physical strength  not strong in character  diluted  not convincing 1 This gives us an idea of what is meant  Weak is something that is not convincing or lacking the necessary strength to be convincing  Highly asymmetric  on the other hand  is a measure of comparison  Asymmetry requires something to be compared to something else  As stated in the Cambridge Dictionary  asymmetry is the  condition of not being equal or equally available between two people or groups  2 What most likely is meant by highly asymmetric in this context is a comparison between the participants of the transaction   A second part can cause some confusion  agency  Satz then adds to the confusion by stating that    a  gency problems also arise in markets in which one of the affected parties is not directly involved in the transaction but depends on others to transact for her  In such cases  we cannot be certain that the party herself actually benefits from the transaction    P  96   Again  according to the dictionaries  agency can mean twofold  Either it describes a  capacity  condition  or state of acting or of exerting power   or it describes  a person or thing through which power is exerted or an end is achieved  3 The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy provides that    i  n general terms  an agent is a being with the capacity to act  and  agency  denotes the exercise or manifestation of this capacity  4 Satz states that    a  gency failures can occur because some of the direct participants lack important knowledge or because the market has serious indirect effects on people who are not involved in the market transaction    p  96  This quote could be misconstrued as attaching the later meaning to agency  yet  I suggest  that Satz s meaning for agency is  agency as a capacity  condition  or state of acting or exerting power  for two reasons   First  the concept of weak agency shall not only be applied to situations where the person acts on behalf of someone  i e   as an agent  but more generally weak agency is also applicable to situations where a person is acting on their behalf  Second  I claim  what Satz is trying to achieve is to declare as noxious any market  where the party is going to suffer because of missing knowledge  to which we will come in a second  or cognitive capacity  i e   agency   So  then we have an idea of what is meant by the parameter of weak agency  A market scores high on weak agency if the actors in the market have very weak or highly asymmetric knowledge and agency   A third part might need just a little explanation  knowledge  According to the Cambridge Dictionary   knowledge  means the  understanding of or information about a subject that you get by experience or study  either known by one person by people generally  or the  state of knowing about or being familiar with something  5 Merriam Webster provides a very similar definition     T  he fact or condition of knowing something with familiarity    acquaintance with or understanding of science  art  technique    the fact or condition of being aware of something   or  the range of one s information or understanding  6  Knowledge is  therefore  the ability to understand information and the state of knowing the information  This needs no further discussion  as it is an unambiguous understanding that corresponds with the colloquial meaning and use of the term   Let us now have a look at the example of child labor  and how Satz argues that child labor scores high on weak agency  At the beginning of the chapter on child labor  pp  156 157   Satz describes a child as  a person who is in some fundamental way not developed  but rather developing   Because a child is still developing and does not yet have the necessary capacities to deliberate and act competently in their interests  adult parents or surrogates must  protect  nurture  and educate children   so Satz  p  157   Her description of a child to me is intuitively plausible  and I will spend no time discussing it further  Satz s reasoning is straightforward  Because a child is still developing  it is the obligation of the parent or surrogate to help the child develop  i e    protect  nurture  and educate    Because a child cannot develop him  or herself  it needs to be supported  That support should stem from the surrogate 7  Satz then claims that children cannot be assumed to have full agency  as they do not have the cognitive  moral  affective capacities of adults  nor the power within their families  and are unable to decide on the allocation of their time   P  157  This supports our analysis of the meaning of agency in the previous part  Agency as a capacity  As children do not have the cognitive  moral  and affective capacities  i e   full agency   they are unable to decide on the allocation of their time and need the help of a surrogate  I would agree with her because it is plausible that children  since they are developing  do not yet have developed their full capacities  and do not have full agency   In a second step  Satz claims that to be ascribed full agency  a child  or family member  must at least have some power within their families to make decisions  What Satz is trying to say is that children are not able to allocate their time  Instead  they depend on someone else to tell them what to do  i e   to allocate their time   Satz illustrates her premises by referring to Jane Humphries8 and points out that most children that work are put to work by their parents  p  157   The children are at their parents  mercy  She states that    w  e cannot simply assume that the head of household functions as a benevolent dictator in the interest of the family as a whole    P  158  But is the weak agency of the child relevant for the evaluation of the noxiousness of the market  Couldn t it be that the surrogate has sufficient agency to act on behalf of the child   Does all this mean that there a  child labor market  would score high on the dimension of weak agency and asymmetric knowledge  Is there weak agency in child labor markets  According to Satz  a  child labor market  differs from an ideal labor market in that the decision maker may lack important information regarding the consequences of his or her choice  This  as seen above  would fulfill the requirement for weak agency  Referring to Dreze and Gazdar 9 Satz quotes     T  he ability of parents to assess the personal and social value of education depends  among other things  on the information they have at their personal disposal    P  158   One serious moral concern of child labor  therefore  is that the decision to put children to labor is made under a lack of information about the consequences of that choice  made by the parents or a surrogate as the decision maker   This is what Satz describes as  agency problems   p  158   and what is meant to correspond and fulfill the criterion of a weak agency  It includes surrogate decisions  ignorance  uncertainty about the future cost and benefits of educating one s children   Yet  I claim there is a pertinent ambiguity that has to be addressed  Satz is not entirely clear on who has to be subject to weak agency  In the following  I shall try to understand what Satz could have meant   Let us assume  the employer and the surrogate both have no knowledge of the consequences of child labor  Is the level of weak agency still fulfilled  There are two possible answers and underlying arguments  We could argue that the weak agency is still fulfilled because the comparison is no longer  or never was  between the surrogate and the employer  but between the surrogate and the market as a whole  While this seems a possible interpretation at first glance  it adds to the complexity of our evaluation of weak agency  In every market assessment case  we would now have to evaluate the weak agency not only between the market participants but also between the market participants and the market as a whole  However  impracticality by itself is not a criterion for a reasonable criticism because there might be a plausible reason why the parameter is impractical   Yet additionally  this interpretation fails to achieve what Satz is looking for  in my opinion  Using this parameter is essentially to declare noxious any markets  or market transactions  that allows  or enables  an extreme form of knowledge inequality  It is  if you will  a market transaction that is based on deception and fraud  This parameter is not  I suggest  only aimed at markets  or market transactions  that involve the immediate participants  i e   the surrogate and the employer in the case of child labor  Not only would an extension of the subjects of weak agency make the evaluation harder  but it also fails to achieve Satz s goal  because she is trying to declare any market transaction  or market  noxious that is based on knowledge inequality   We have ruled out the first possibility  that if employer and surrogate both are equally unknowledgeable  the scope of the parameter would encompass the market as such  We can  therefore  safely assume that what most likely is meant by market participants are the actual market transaction participants  i e   the surrogate and the employer in the case of child labor    Let us instead suppose that the surrogate is fully aware of the consequences of child labor  i e   has knowledge   but the employer is not  The constellation is hard to imagine  A surrogate that is fully aware of the consequences of child labor would likely abstain from putting the child into labor  One possibility is that the surrogate out of desperation resorts to child labor  In that case  the second of Satz s parameter  vulnerability  would come into action  However  when a fully informed surrogate and an uninformed employer agree to child labor  then the parameter of weak agency would  in my opinion  not be fulfilled  Which market transaction participant is unknowledgeable seems relevant  It seems that Satz focuses on the knowledge of the party that likely is going to suffer from its weak agency  I shall  therefore  specify the parameter of weak agency in the following way  Weak agency only leads to a high score of noxiousness  if the sufferer of weak agency is also going to suffer from the consequences   A third possibility is that both surrogate and employer are equally knowledgeable about the consequences of child labor  This is a more theoretical scenario and supports my claim about the sufferer of the consequences  It shows that it is irrelevant whether the employer has knowledge about the consequences  From a purely economic standpoint  if an employer can employ a child to do the same work for less cost  then he would do so irrespective of the consequences for the child  This behavior might be unethical  but assuming we are evaluating the noxiousness of the market  we have to begin a   clean slate  where everything is allowed  Only then can we evaluate what market should either be regulated or declared illegal   Of all the three scenarios  I claim any scenario that has the sufferer of the consequences  the surrogate  or more precise the child of the surrogate  that has weak agency and knowledge is the most plausible and achieves what Satz intends   However  there is an additional criticism in Satz s conceptualization of weak agency  While Satz does mention knowledge and agency  she does not explicitly  though maybe implicitly  mention the availability and comprehensibility of information  Of course  the agency problems  i e   surrogate decision making  ignorance  uncertainty about the future cost  and benefits of education of a child  in my opinion  cannot be solved by simply providing additional information  However  what also should count is that the information is sufficient and comprehensible because even if the information is available  the information is only useful if it can and is understood by the sufferer  Only then can it at least allow the chance that a change occurs  and the weak agency and highly asymmetric knowledge dissolves   Yet  even if  as Satz states  the choice in favor of child labor is made in a fully informed and deliberate manner  this would not necessarily morally justify it   P  158 169  This an important point Satz makes  Even if the level of weak agency is not high  enough   this is only an indication that the market is not noxious  However  if a market does not contain weak agency  this doesn t morally justify the action of putting your child to labor or employing children  as there are three additional parameters to focus on  that could declare a market noxious  If poor families are facing background circumstances and options that are unjust   the option does not by some mysterious process suddenly become just    P  158  The key to the moral assessment  so Satz  is based on the moral legitimacy of the socially available choices an agent faces   P  158 159  What Satz states is that the circumstances of a family are of importance for the decision in favor of child labor  This is what Satz covers as her second dimension of assessment of market noxiousness  Asymmetric vulnerability     Asymmetric vulnerability    Satz describes her second parameter of asymmetric vulnerability as the risk of the weaker party to be exploited due to different capacities   When people come to the market with widely varying resources or widely different capacities to understand the terms of their transaction  they are unequally vulnerable to one another  In such circumstances the weaker party is at risk of being exploited    P  97   We have discussed the term of asymmetry in the previous section  The discussion is applicable to this section in the same manner  Vulnerability  though  is new  The Cambridge Dictionary describes vulnerability as  the quality to be easily hurt  influenced  or attacked  or something that is vulnerable  10 Asymmetric vulnerability exists when two market transaction participants are unequally vulnerable  according to Satz  Now  she extends the scope  As I will explain  this is problematic  Not only market transaction participants  i e   surrogate and employer  are relevant  but also others are taken into account for the evaluation of vulnerability  Satz states that this vulnerability becomes apparent either in exchanges between the children and their employers or in the situation of the family itself  According to Satz  when a family is in a precarious situation  they are more likely to take desperate steps and put their children to labor   P  159  Let us  therefore  more generally state that the more vulnerable a market participant or the direr his or her situation  the more likely a participant is to accept unfavorable terms  especially if there is no other option   and  by conclusion  the higher the level of vulnerability in Satz s framework  I agree with Satz on this point  It needs no further explanation   Referring to the practical example of child labor  Satz states that families in very dire situations are often uneducated and illiterate  and in some countries caste and ethnic division may add to the vulnerability   P  159  She then claims that the parameter of vulnerability itself can have different spheres  and expands the scope of the vulnerability further  Child labor can reflect an unequal vulnerability within families  so Satz  Some families sacrifice a working child for the sake of the other or other family members  Even more  child labor might also reflect the power and resource inequalities between the mother and the father  She states that growing evidence suggests that mothers have a stronger preference than fathers for investing in their children s welfare  including education   P  159   Satz describes three spheres of vulnerability that have an influence on child labor  The vulnerability of the child to the society and or their employers  the vulnerability of the child within the family  and the vulnerability of the child within the power struggle of the mother and the father   P  159  What Satz does not take into account is the vulnerability of the family itself or society as a whole  She does not mention factors that  in my opinion  are equally relevant to the parameter of vulnerability  Families that employ child labor are vulnerable to the society as a whole  Satz might counter that the family is vulnerable to the society as a whole does not influence the vulnerability of the child  but in this case  the vulnerability of the family as a whole will have a significant influence on the asymmetric vulnerability  For example  the status of the family within their community to be counted as honorable could have an impact on putting a child to labor to have more financial means and thereby better the situation of the family within the community   Additionally  Satz ignores the vulnerability of the society as a whole  Suppose country A is one of many yet a significant producer for clothing to country B  The prices for clothing in country B pays are so high  that they make up a significant amount of country A s GDP  Now  suppose  country B decides to look for cheaper producers in other countries  If there is no weak agency  country A is vulnerable and very likely is going to do  almost  anything to stay in business with B  This dynamic will then  so I claim  trickle down to the micro level  Where countries  families  parents  employers  or children are extremely vulnerable  and are  at the same time  market transaction participants  they are likely to participate in the market on any  or at least very unfavorable  terms offered   I believe that far more dynamic processes are in place than what Satz is able to cover with this parameter  The status within their community  the status of the family within their society  but also the status of the community within the society   This practical example of the parameter of asymmetric vulnerability  I claim  shows a relevant issue with Satz s parameter  It is difficult to define the scope  Yet  the scope of the parameter is important because it influences the results on the noxiousness of a specific market     Harmful outcomes for the individual    The third dimension of market evaluation is the level of harmful outcomes for the individual  The higher the level of outcomes for the individual  the likelier the market is noxious  according to Satz   P  94  For the example of child labor  let us also assume that to develop all your capabilities  i e   overcome weak agency   a child has to have a certain amount of education  Any education takes time   child  labor also takes time  and a child only has a finite amount of time  Therefore any time  that a child is at labor  it has less time for education and thereby less time to develop its capabilities  Referring to Amartya Sen 12 Satz states that children have two kinds of interests  welfare interests and agency interests   P  160  Welfare interest covers a child s well being  i e   shelter  food  health  education  bodily integrity  as well as a stable and loving relationship with the parents    Agency interests are not as easy to understand  but with the understanding of agency that we developed earlier agency interests describe the fact that actions have to be in favor of the child gradually developing the capabilities  i e   the capacities  to  set goals for themselves  and to choose and act by their own values    P  160   It is necessary  so Satz  that parents protect and provide for these interests because children are not yet able to do so by themselves   P  160  Satz states that there are basic agency and well being that have to be fulfilled  and failure should be considered abusive to the child  It could hinder the development of crucial adult capabilities  According to Satz  child labor that violates these basic interests13 should or could constitute extreme harm for the individual  i e   the child    P  161   As a third moral concern of child labor Satz sets the stage with the following quote   The nature of the damage generated by child labor markets depends on the form of child labor    P  159   There are several issues to be discussed with this parameter  First  like with the other parameter  it is not entirely clear what she means by  individual   Take the situation of the child and its surrogate  Who has to suffer from extreme harm  The child or the surrogate  Satz seems to refer to the harm that child labor has for the future of the child or stated more generally in the terms we have used above  The harmful outcomes for the individual refer to the outcomes for the actual sufferer of the market  This becomes clear when looking at the fourth parameter  harmful outcomes for the society   which by contrast covers any outcome on other subjects  including family members  the society  other people  etc  Yet  Satz does not state it unambiguously   The second issue with this parameter of harmful outcomes for the individual is that we can t reliably foresee the outcome of a certain market  It seems to be a silly argument because  in the case of child labor  most people would agree that it has harmful outcomes for the child  However  in other cases  the harmful outcomes might not be as obvious  Suppose you have a market for X  and X won t show its outcome for the individual until 50 years from now  How do you evaluate that harmful outcome  In most cases  you would rely on empirical research  And in the case of child labor  there is plenty of evidence of the harmful outcome on the child  But what if you do not have any empirical research on the specific market  and no comparable market is available  My criticism again concerns the practicality  The importance and use of the parameter  I do not contest  How it actually should be used  is more controversial  because the outcome relies on several factors  Satz does provide context by stating that especially the violation of basic interests constitutes an extremely harmful outcome for the individual  But in markets with which we have little previous experience  this parameter becomes hard to assess  I assume that the assessment of this parameter  as perhaps with all parameters  is based on an  intuitive qualitative  rather than an  analytic quantitative  assessment  This puts Satz s framework at danger of being unintentionally diluted by subjective views  biases  and experiences of the assessor   Let me summarize  I agree with Satz on the importance of the parameter of harmful outcomes for the individual  However  I doubt that this parameter is as easy to evaluate  as shown in the case of child labor     Harmful outcomes for the society    As a fourth dimension  Satz claims that where a market has harmful outcomes for the society  the noxiousness of this market is likelier  On a social level  child labor can generate harm even for a society  so Satz  Children that grow to be uneducated  illiterate  and passive adults cannot contribute to social development   P  162  Therefore  the existence of child labor may inhibit the long term productive development        needed to help the poor move out of their desperate circumstances or to raise up the wealth of a nation    P  161 162  Again  my criticism with this parameter is similar to the one made on harmful outcomes for the individual  What exactly is the scope of this parameter  How should it be measured  Perhaps even more extreme is the evaluation of long term consequences for a society as opposed to the individual  I have to reiterate my concerns of the previous parameter  Satz assesses this parameter in an  intuitive qualitative  rather than an  analytic quantitative  manner  This puts her framework at danger of being unintentionally diluted by subjective views  biases  and experiences of the assessor     Summary    Concluding the paper on Satz s four parameters as used in the cased of child labor  we can state the following  On weak agency and asymmetric knowledge  we first clarified the meaning of the terms  Then tried to identify who has to be subject to the weak agency or suffer from asymmetric knowledge  We concluded that for the parameter of weak agency or asymmetric knowledge scores high if the sufferer of the weak agency or asymmetric knowledge is also the sufferer of the consequences  Additionally  I drew attention to the missing reference to sufficient and comprehensible information to mitigate the weak agency and asymmetric knowledge   On asymmetric vulnerability  we stated that  generally  that the more vulnerable a market participant is or the direr his or her situation  the more likely a participant is to accept unfavorable terms  and the higher the level of vulnerability  We drew our attention to the fact that Satz extends the scope by including the vulnerability of the child to the society  to the employers  and also the vulnerability of the child within the family  Yet  we criticized that Satz s scope is not broad enough  It does not  or only implicitly  include the vulnerability of the family within the society  the vulnerability of the family within their community  or even the society as a whole  All these elements have a trickle down effect on the vulnerability of the subject  We have pointed out that it is difficult to define the scope of these parameters  yet the scope of a parameter is crucial because it influences the results of our assessment   On the harmful outcome for the individual  we have concluded that it refers to the actual sufferer of the market transaction  and criticized that harmful outcome is difficult to evaluate as it often lies far in the future  On the harmful outcome for the society we have  again  criticized that the scope is extended  yet  not entirely clear on how to be evaluated   As a general criticism  I have stated that some parameters  or perhaps even all parameters  seem to rely not on an  analytic quantitative  evaluation not on an  intuitive qualitative  evaluation  which puts Satz framework at danger of being unintentionally influenced by subjective views  biases and the experiences of the assessor  However  in conclusion  the framework does act as a solid first stepping stone in the reasoned assessment of markets  especially in cases where markets endanger the social democratic structure   1    2    3    4    5    6    7 In what follows  I shall refer to any parent or surrogate as  surrogate    8 Jane Humphires  1999  argued that there is no infans economicus  i e   that children lack the capacity to think in economic terms    9 Dreze  J  and

Well being  Agency  and Freedom  The Dewey Lectures 1984   Journal of Philosophy 82  no  4  1985   169 221   13 What Satz also highlights is that we have to favor the  basic interests  standard over the so called  best interests  standard that some children s advocates have proposed to assess child labor  because the  best interests  standard has two disadvantages  First  she states  there is no widely shared view of what constitutes a child s best interest  and is therefore open to widely different interpretations  Second  the  best interests  standard according to Satz assumes that parents are  mere instruments for optimizing their children s interests   Satz claims that moral standpoint is wrong   There is no inherent injustice in family structures that assume that children must make some contribution to the well being of the family    p  161  This  in my opinion  is a statement that bears little explanation  It is understandable that children have to do their part  chores  in maintaining a good family life  as soon as they are old enough and capable  But and I think from what Satz says this could be inferred  the chores of a child have to be age and capacity appropriate  In most cases a child would even learn a thing a two that would provide to them to lead a successful life in the

philosophy,2020-07-07 07:26:33,The Flies and Spiders Fallacy,hmnok5,28,19,I enjoy reading about philosophy and thinking about logic and I think I ve identified a really common fallacy people make in arguments  but I don t know if anyone has ever defined it or given it a name so I d like to  forgive me if this is already a thing and I m just ignorant    Originally  I was going to call this  The Sub Set Fallacy of Mistaken Transitivity  because I feel smart saying that and because it literally describes what the fallacy is  but after reflecting on other fallacy names like  the straw man fallacy  or  the hot hand fallacy  I decided to give it the more simple name   The Flies and Spiders Fallacy   To understand this fallacy  you need to understand what  the transitive property of equality  is and what  subsets  are  I ll explain the transitive property in the next paragraph and what subsets are in the following one  If you know what one or both of these things are  feel free to skip either or both of these next paragraphs   The Transitive Property of Equality is a simple concept to understand  Literally it is defined as  If A B and B C then A C   To put this in a real world context  imagine you re putting a shelf on a wall  You measure the part of the wall with a measuring tape  Now the measuring tape is the length of the part of the wall  Then you cut a peice of wood to the length of the measuring tape  If the measuring tape is the length of the wall and the cut shelf is the length of the tape then you can trust that the shelf will be the length of the wall  This reasoning is called  transitivity    Now you need to understand subsets  A subset is a category within a category  You may remember learning that all squares are rectangles  but not all rectangles are squares  You can describe this relationship by saying  squares are a subset of rectangles   Another example is bugs and insects  When bugs have 6 legs  they are called insects  All insects are bugs  but not all bugs are insects because arachnids  like spiders  exists and they have 8 legs  With this said  lets talk about my fallacy   The Flies and Spiders fallacy happens when people try to make a transitive property argument  but rather than using things that are equal  they use things that are subsets of each other and are not totally equal  Hear is my example of this Fallacy   All insects are bugs  All arachnids are also bugs  So insects must be arachnids  With that said  flies are insects and spiders are arachnids and therefore flies are spiders   Flies are obviously not spiders and this is a silly example  but I see this structure of argument too frequently for it to not have a name   Recently with the Black Lives Matter movement  I see a lot of post saying  BLM tear down statues and the government looks away just as Nazis tore down statues  How can we let modern Nazis do this in America      This takes the same structure as the  flies are spiders  argument  Throughout history  many people have taken down statues for different reasons  BLM is a subset of  statue removers  and Nazis are a subset of  statue removers   but because these things are subsets and are not totally equal you cannot logically use a transitive argument   I d love to see your examples of The Flies and Spiders Fallacy because the internet is riddled with them  Thanks for reading,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/hmnok5/the_flies_and_spiders_fallacy/

philosophy,2020-06-23 07:08:47,Haidbauer Incident and Wittgenstein s Philosophy,he7o0j,5,11,Hello all   As one of the most preeminent philosophers of the 20th century  the name Ludwig Wittgenstein is often mentioned on this subreddit  His ideas such as language games  private language  and forms of life continue to be topics of discussion for many contemporary philosophers  Wittgenstein has become somewhat venerated  and as far as modern philosophers come  is the closest to being sanctified  Bertrand Russell referred to him as  the closest thing to a perfect genius I ever saw    But it only takes a cursory look at Wittgenstein s personal writings or behavior for one to be immediately appalled   I know that human beings on the average are not worth much anywhere  but  here they are much more good for nothing and irresponsible than  elsewhere   This is just one of many examples of Wittgenstein s elitism evidenced in his letters   One example of his holiness often presented is the time he gave up his wealth as one of the richest men in Austria to become a rural schoolteacher  This sounds rather egalitarian  but the reason Wittgenstein became a schoolteacher was to demonstrate in praxis some of his philosophical ideas  As a thorough logician  he believed since mathematics was axiomatic  he could teach a group of school children advanced mathematical concepts  If one reads his Tractatus  you can see how Wittgenstein s mind operated at this point from step 1  2  3  etc  Villagers from that area would refer to Wittgenstein as  that totally insane fellow who wanted to introduce advanced mathematics to our elementary school children   Some had a high opinion of Wittgenstein  especially since he would use his resources to take the children on museum trips to Vienna  however one of the students was the developmentally challenged Josef Haidbauer  who could not comprehend Wittgenstein s lesson plans and in return was boxed around the ears by Wittgenstein  Some may say this was just standard punishment at the time  but this is not so  He clearly went far beyond any normal  smack on the wrist with a ruler   Wittgenstein hit Haidbauer so hard  that he was knocked unconscious  Haidbauer was the son of a single mother  who worked as a maid on a farm  The farmer acted as a sort of surrogate father  and when he found out about what happened   he was livid and basically went to go kick his ass  But Ludwig  being a rich Viennese aristocrat  fled to the city   He was prosecuted for this act  And in court  Ludwig Wittgenstein  the great proponent of logical atomism  perjured himself to avoid further criminal liability  This incident is not one of the things that jumps to mind when one thinks Wittgenstein  The reason I bring this up is because it clearly had a monumental impact on Wittgenstein himself  who referred to himself as a coward due to his behavior  The philosopher famous for attempting to investigate logic itself down to its atomistic constituents felt  nauseated  at the idea of being examined in court   I m not bringing this up to sully his reputation  my point is  Wittgenstein perjuring himself clearly had a major impact on his philosophy  which is often regarded as esoteric  but in light of the Haidbaeur incident  it becames far more understandable  The  shift  between early and later Wittgenstein which so aggravated analytical positivists  when he seemed to undermine his own previous statements  Language for Wittgenstein went from being a  tool  to being a  game    private language   the malleability of language   Courts are where people are supposed to be held to a set deontological ruleset based on ethics  truths  morality  etc  When he saw that he lied and got away with it  he realized that language is much more complicated than just a simple tool  It has the ability to be shifted or warped depending on the  game  one is playing  Clearly  Wittgenstein couldn t just write  I ve been thinking an awful lot about that time I beat up a developmentally disabled child then lied about it  and what this may mean in terms of truth values   Haidbauer couldn t speak for himself and had no resources  the fact that couldn t communicate made Wittgenstein so angry that he beat him  There was a problem between the two based on miscommunication in their forms of life  and I think this directly influenced Wittgenstein s main theses  that there are no philosophical questions  only miscommunications in language which philosophy seeks to clarify  Discussion of pain and mental states appears in philosophical investigations as well  In trying to understand the differences between himself and Josef Haidbaeur  I believe Wittgenstein began to philosophically investigate the underlying ways language is used on an every day basis  which led him to realize language can mean different things to different people depending upon situational context   tl dr  Wittgenstein beating a child and lying about it made him think about the ways language can be manipulated  which opened the doorway to his later philosophical investigations,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/he7o0j/haidbauer_incident_and_wittgensteins_philosophy/

philosophy,2020-06-12 19:54:49,Philosophy of the African American Experience  Readings and Lectures ,h7ogxn,26,2,Hello  r philosophy   With the recent political events  I thought it prudent to post a list of publicly accessible sources for those who wish to education themselves on the problems of race in America  More specifically  these readings are aimed to provide a basic understanding of the philosophical conditions that enabled racism to both exist and flourish in the United States  as well as providing philosophical accounts of the lived black experience in America from the times of slavery through modern times  These sources are derived directly from a class titled  The Philosophy of the African American Experience  that I found to be extraordinarily illuminating in grasping the basic understanding of not only the lived black experience  but seeing how deeply rooted racist ideology is in American society   The intention of this post is to provide relevant readings  lectures  and interviews  in chronological order  for individuals with no previous background on the subject to be able to pick up and go through a journey of philosophical thought    Each reading will be accompanied by a  Reading Commitment   which  as it suggests  gives an approximate amount of time one would have to dedicate to complete the reading from start to finish      Full disclaimer    these readings are meant to provoke thought in the reader  Some of it is considered to be highly offensive by today s standard and the apologies put forth by some of the authors are passionate and moving  If these readings anger you  make you question racism  or provoke you to want to learn more    this post has served its purpose    This is by no means an exhaustive list  There is a TON of reading material on the subject  but I found these not only easily accessible  but they are structured in such a way that a reader can follow the progression of philosophical thought  Additionally  I will provide a small list of lectures   interviews at the end to either supplement the reading or enable those who do not wish to read to get acquainted with some of the ideas presented in the readings      Readings    1785   Thomas Jefferson s   Notes on the State of Virginia    Ch  14     Begin at      To emancipate all slaves born after passing the act   End at     When freed  he is to be removed beyond the reach of mixture     Reading Commitment  10 15 minutes     1829   David Walker s  Appeal  Reply to Jefferson        This link includes the entire appeal  However  I recommend using that link simply for the Preamble and then reading  Article I  Our Wretchedness in Consequence of Slavery   and then  Article II  Our Wretchedness in Consequence of Ignorance    Reading Commitment for Preamble  Article I   II  35 65 minutes     1857    Dred Scott v  Sandford       Important a pivotal case for black rights   Here   is the Khan Academy video that also explains it   Reading Commitment  10 20 minutes    Video  19 minutes       1861   Harriet Jacobs   Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl    Ch  8   9   Reading Commitment  15 25 minutes     1861   1865   American Civil War  for reference     1866    America s First Civil Rights Act       This provides the reader some of the constitutional changes that came as a result of the civil war  Of the numerous public sources  this seems to hit it the best as it summarizes a great deal of information   Reading Commitment  25   120 minutes    Varied due to multiple links within the read itself       1880 s   Alexander Crummell s   We Need Character        This takes you to a google search  The first link from Dialnet gives an automatic PDF download  Relevant pages are p  5 16 on the PDF  This also gives a nice bibliography at the end for further readings  I originally intended to link  The Negro as a Source of Conservative Power      but I could not find this online  The link provided gives a summary of Crummell s thoughts  There is also a nice  SEP   article  but might be much for an introductory reader   Reading Commitment  25 60 minutes     1845   Frederick Douglass   Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass  An American Slave         Full book here  but a great read for understanding the lived experience of being black during this time  Suggested Reading      Chapter 7   PDF pp  50 56    Reading Commitment  15 25 minutes    Chapter 8   PDF pp  57 62    Reading Commitment  15 25 minutes    Chapter 9   PDF pp  63 68    Reading Commitment  15 25 minutes    Chapter 10   PDF pp 69 103    Reading Commitment  45 75 minutes     1895   Booker T  Washington s  Atlanta Exposition Speech       It would be a good exercise to compare the thoughts of Washington and Crummell as they both have different approaches to the problem of racism   Reading Commitment  10 15 minutes     1896   Plessy v  Ferguson  Short Version   and  Long Version       Another pivotal case   Reading Commitment  short   10 15 minutes     Long   45 65 minutes     1903   W E B Dubois   Souls of Black Folk  Ch 1   and  Ch 3       Chapter 1 is titled  Of Our Spiritual Strivings  and Chapter 3 is  Of Mr  Booker T  Washington and Others    Reading Commitment  Ch 1  25 45 minutes    Ch  3  30 60 minutes     1952   Frantz Fanon s   Black Skin  White Masks         This is an excellent read  but we need not read it all  Here  we begin to hit philosophical altitude of the lived experience of being black  This reading can be challenging for introductory reading  but is more accessible to those who have read everything up until this point  There is a lot to unpack here and it is suggested to watch some of the supplementary lectures listed below AFTER reading the text  Suggested readings as follows      Introduction   PDF pp  40 46    Reading Commitment  15 25 minutes    Chapter 1   The Negro and Language    PDF pp  47 66    Reading Commitment  45 75 minutes    Chapter 5   The Fact of Blackness    PDF pp  121 147    Reading

1963   Martin Luther King Jr   Letter from Birmingham Jail    Reading Commitment  30 45 minutes     1964   Malcolm X  The Ballot or the Bullet       Similar to the comparison of Crummell and Washington  it would be a good exercise to compare the thoughts of Martin Luther King Jr  and Malcolm X   Reading Commitment  30 45 minutes     1967   Kwame Ture   Charles V  Hamilton   Black Power  Politics of Liberation in America         Similar to  Black Skin  White Masks   this another excellent and powerful read  However  for our purposes we will focus on the first two chapters  Suggested readings as follows     Chapter 1   White Power  The Colonial Situation    PDF pp  20 35    Reading Commitment  45 75 minutes    Chapter 2   Black Power  Its Need and Substance    PDF pp  38 48    Reading Commitment  35 60 minutes     1982   Cornel West  A Genealogy of Modern Racism       It should be noted that West is a prominent public intellectual and if you find this reading enjoyable  he has many other works  This essay hits on some philosophical topics that may require some follow up and secondary reading  so I advise researching some of the ideas afterward to solidify the understanding   Reading Commitment  45 65 minutes      1988   Peggy McIntosh  White Privilege  Unpacking the Invisible Knapsack       If have not read anything above  read this short essay as it gets some major points across  This is simple  succinct  and will get you thinking   Reading Commitment  15 25 minutes     2000   Lewis Gordon   Existentia Africana        This is a higher level philosophy read that will be inaccessible to those who did not do the prior reading  but I am linking it in the event that someone did trudge through all of this and wanted to see higher level thought  If you did not do the readings  worry not  Go ahead and skip to the lectures  Gordon  among being a great writer and brilliant philosopher  also has good lectures  For those who wish to try their hand at this  you will find that Gordon references almost everything above in some fashion  Suggested Reading      Chapter 1   Africana Philosophy of Existence    PDF pp  14 34    Reading Commitment  75 90 minutes    Chapter 2   A Problem of Biography in Africana Thought    PDF pp  35 53    Reading Commitment  75 90 minutes    Chapter 3   Frederick Douglas as an Existentialist    PDF pp  54 74    Reading Commitment  75 90 minutes   As previously mentioned  this is not an exhaustive list  but a start  I suggest taking these readings bit by bit over time and keeping in mind that these were spread out over 16 weeks  Gordon s reading is by far the most difficult  but fruitful  Either way  I commend anyone who spends even an hour clicking through some of these links and reading on a subject that they previously may not have known to exist      Lectures   Interviews  For those who did not want to read or for those who want to supplement their readings  here are a few lectures that are fruitful to watch in understanding the subject at hand  Again  this will not be exhaustive  but is supposed to help acquaint someone with the philosophical thoughts concerning race in America

philosophy,2020-06-05 23:40:35,On category mistakes and metaphor with presuppositional theory,gxcm5q,2,0,In this essay  I would like to address an analysis of category mistakes  More specifically  I would like to address them through an argument from metaphor  For the purpose of this essay  I will speak of category mistakes as metaphors    There are two types of arguments from metaphor that were being discussed in Ofra Magidor s  Category Mistakes   One type is that metaphors do not require literal meanings  This is to say that was is stated in the metaphor is not its literal meaning but what it says pertains to something else  The second type is that metaphor requires literal meanings  This states that what is said in a metaphor is its literal meaning  If a metaphor has a literal meaning it is then meaningful and so are category mistakes in the same way    With regards to the first type  saying a metaphor does not have a literal meaning but something else that it denotes misses the point of a metaphor  This type of theory is like describing an abstract painting to someone and never showing them the painting  You could explain every detail of the picture and would be left with two scenarios  If your description is not perfect then you will miss something like the  emotion in the brush strokes   or at least give a barren description of them  If you were somehow to capture the entirety of the picture in words  the listener would have no need for your words thereafter  One theory of substituting and expanding the metaphor substitute expands  her eyes were diamonds  as  her eyes were bright  shiny  clear  etc    If this were the  metaphorical  meaning of the sentence  it is just that this alternative is another literal meaning  The use of the word diamond could be said to have a secondary use  However  what is special about a poetic phrase is how the words play and relate to each other  To paraphrase lacks the poetic effect or at least has a different one  You will never be able to describe what  her eyes were diamonds  meant more perfectly than  her eyes were diamonds    Expansive descriptions of what someone meant by  her eyes were diamonds  will fall short  For these reasons  I will be discussing the second theory in which metaphor has a literal meaning  More specifically I will use the presupposition account offered by Ofra Magidor in which the felicity  or infelicity  is predicted by what is taken for granted   Note Standard typical context  how words are used generally everyday baring special cases   Datum 1    Colorless green ideas sleep furiously   Noam Chomsky   This famous example originally used as something that is both grammatical and according to Chomsky meaningless  Under the framework present by Ofra Magidor it is infelicitous  In the first section  colorless green  it is taken for granted that the green is a color and thus cannot be colorless  In this regard  because of the presupposition is a color   colorless green  suffers from a presupposition failure and is then infelicitous  Another tied part of the sentence  green ideas  also suffers from presupposition failure as ideas are  in standard context  not taken to have colors  I take the  green idea  to not be an idea about something that is green  Ofra Magidor states that  sleep furiously  exhibits a presupposition failure as  in standard contexts speakers take for granted that sleep is performed with no emotion    1     This is where it starts to get a little sticky as we head more towards poetry and metaphor  The presupposition becomes harder to discern though I believe it still possesses the rigor to do so  So called  standard context  loses its governance the further we stray from everyday speech  I intend to show this is how it should be   Datum 2    Juliet is the Sun   Romeo   This 19th century poem is filled with a type of category mistake likened to one talked about by Ofra Magidor except her version was  the number 2 is green   I see these as similar as both numbers and letters are presumed in standard context to not have a color  The standard context is the things that are normally taken for granted in discussions of things of letters  This is what is presupposed and when this fails it is considered infelicitous in standard context  The statement  E is white  would be infelicitous through presupposition failure if you were talking about the spelling of  electric eel  and said   Well E is white and electric eels are not so there can t be an E in its spelling   This would be both wrong and infelicitous  Still  the context of a poem is given special attention  This poem was investigated by French literary scholar René Etiemble in which he came to the conclusion of  Why  flies    tents    lips    bugles   Because the poet has seen them  Why has he seen them  because he is a poet        This original symbolism  which is impossible to reconstruct  to formulate in an equation  must be accepted  must be submitted to    2    Datum 3    Dreams    Langston Hughes  Hold fast to dreams  For if dreams die  Life is a broken winged bird  That cannot fly  Hold fast to dreams  For when dreams go  Life is a barren field  Frozen with snow   At first glance and in the typical application of language it seems infelicitous to  hold onto dreams  or that  dreams die   It is taken for granted that a  dream  is not something tangible and  holding  is typically reserved for something tangible so one would expect this to be a presupposition failure  Of course  this is so if operating with the standard presupposition of the word s  hold  and  dream   However  this is poetry  and leeway is to be given to the poet  a prominent theme to come   The metaphors expressed in this poem must be taken as literal meanings under the presupposition account  The way the words play and intermingle within the poem conveys a message  This message can be analyzed but not paraphrased adequately enough so that the poem should not be needed to convey the same message   Datum 4    Vowels  by Arthur Rimbaud  English translation   A black  E white  I red  U green  O blue  vowels    I shall tell  one day  of your mysterious origins    A  black velvety jacket of brilliant flies   which buzz around cruel smells  Gulfs of shadow  E  whiteness of vapours and of tents    lances of proud glaciers  white kings  shivers of cow parsley    I  purples  spat blood  smile of beautiful lips   in anger or in the raptures of penitence   U  waves  divine shudderings of viridian seas    the peace of pastures dotted with animals  the peace of the furrows   which alchemy prints on broad studious foreheads   O  sublime Trumpet full of strange piercing sounds    silences crossed by   Worlds and by Angels       O the Omega  the violet ray of   His   Eyes    This 19th century poem is filled with a type of category mistake likened to one talked about by Ofra Magidor except her version was  the number 2 is green   I see these as similar as both numbers and letters are presumed in standard context to not have a color  The standard context is the things that are normally taken for granted in discussions of things of letters  This is what is presupposed and when this fails it is considered infelicitous in standard context  The statement  E is white  would be infelicitous through presupposition failure if you were talking about the spelling of  electric eel  and said   Well E is white and electric eels are not so there can t be an E in its spelling   This would be both wrong and infelicitous  Still  the context of a poem is given special attention  This poem was investigated by French literary scholar René Etiemble in which he came to the conclusion of  Why  flies    tents    lips    bugles   Because the poet has seen them  Why has he seen them  because he is a poet        This original symbolism  which is impossible to reconstruct  to formulate in an equation  must be accepted  must be submitted to    2    Datum 5    China cat Sunflower    written by Robert Hunter performed by The Grateful Dead  Look for a while at the China Cat sunflower    Proud walking jingle in the midnight sun  Copperdome bodhi drip a silver kimono    Like a crazy quilt stargown through a dreamlike wind    Crazy cat peekin  through a lace bandanna   Like a one eyed Cheshire  like a diamond eye jack A leaf of all colors plays a golden string fiddle   To a double E waterfall over my back    Comic book colors on a violin river cryin  Leonardo  Words from out a silk trombone    I rang a silent bell  beneath a shower of pearls    In the eagle winged palace of the Queen Chinee     This is one of my favorite songs and I was very grateful  pun  that it was rife with category mistakes such as  violin river crying   midnight sun   words from out a silk trombone   These are often described as nonsense lyrics although that prescription does not quite fit if you considered their origin  First  though  a  violin river crying  if taken in standard context or in everyday use would be infelicitous  Generally  crying is normally used for something that is able to cry  like a baby and a river does not belong to such things that generally cry  What a  violin river  means is even harder to understand as violins are generally taken to be instruments and in conversation about violins  it is taken for granted that they are instruments  If you said  a violin sings  it would make more sense as  sings  is a musical term and in discussion with other musicians saying an instrument sings is hardly infelicitous  A  violin river  is clearly infelicitous in normal use as none of the things taken for granted with  violins  and  river  would show that a  violin river  is proper use  With  midnight sun  it is presupposed that midnight happens at night when the sun is not out so there is a failure in presupposition too  However  consider that the lyrics were written by Robert Hunter while lying on his back with a cat on his stomach under the influence of powerful psychedelics in which the cat showed him everything in the song and it becomes pretty clear that in that context the lyrics are  unimaginably  felicitous     Theories of category mistakes are supposed to correctly predict the felicity or infelicity of a given category mistake  The candidate offered by Ofra Magidor is that of presupposition  The felicity of category mistake seems to be due to what is presupposed or taken for granted  Difficulties do arise is determining what is properly presupposed for a category mistake to be  in felicitous  e g   the number 2 is green  is felicitous in a discussion where numbers are presupposed to be colored   However  this difficulty does not seem to be the result of the theory itself being faulty  Rather the difficulties arise in one s ability to see within which game you are playing  Standard or typical contexts  typically taken for granted or believed  see many category mistakes to be infelicitous  However  in poetry especially   standard contexts  and what someone believes is to be taken for granted need not always apply  One problem raised is that this account requires that category mistakes have literal meanings  If they are taken to be metaphorical in design  then I believe this is the case  Still  special attention must be granted to metaphorical literal meanings  The meanings are literal  but they are not a sum of their parts  Replacement in the poet s speech fundamentally changes the metaphor  The meaning exists in how the words play with each other and taken out of context they lose the sense in which they do this  It is often said that poems and metaphors speak about things unutterable and more importantly they do not try to push this envelope  Some things are said in silence  I will finish this essay with a quote that I feel summarizes what I mean by this  After reading Uhland s poem  Graf Eberhards Weissdorn   Wittgenstein comments  The poem by Uhland is really magnificent  And this is how it is  if only you do not try to utter what is unutterable then  nothing  gets lost  But the unutterable will be  unutterably  contained  in what has been uttered     3      x200B     1    pg 145   Category Mistakes       2   Rene  Etiemble   Le Sonnet Des Voyelles  De L Audition Colore e A La Vision Erotique

philosophy,2020-06-05 01:52:22,Heidegger s attitude towards Nietzche s Death of God,gws9dv,11,2,The paper will articulate Nietzsche s statement God is Dead  I will do this by describing the attributes of both incomplete nihilism and complete nihilism   1   Furthermore  I will offer the perspective of Heidegger s attitudes in both agreement and disagreement with Nietzsche s strategy in the wake of the Death of God   For Nietzsche  the devaluation of the highest values is considered to be incomplete or passive nihilism  For Nietzsche  incomplete nihilism  its forms  we live right in their midst  The attempts to escape nihilism without revaluing the former values  they produce the opposite  make the problem more acute    The Will to Power  no  28   To get this point across  one should envision  God  in a sort of place in the supersensory world  Through us  the death of God creates a vacancy in the place of the highest values  The now vacant place of the hitherto highest values still belongs to the supersensory world  This incomplete nihilism puts  nothing  in the place of the highest values  It is incomplete in the sense that it still acknowledges and thus keeps a separation between the sensory and supersensory  In turn  this keeps a highest value in that sense   2   However  it is still a necessary step towards a fulfilling life not based on the supersensory world  The highest of values  belonging to the supersensory world  create a separation between them and the sensory world  In this sense  they devalue themselves from the real or sensory world  This is not to say that unbelief in God is the essence of nihilism but just a consequence as we will see later  Heidegger states   metaphysics  through Nietzsche  has deprived itself of its own essential possibility in certain re spects   Heidegger   Nietzsche s word  God is Dead  pg 157   Metaphysics is used in the same sense as the supersensory by Heidegger   For Nietzsche  the devaluation of the highest values  is considered to be incomplete or passive nihilism  For Nietzsche  incomplete nihilism  its forms  we live right in their midst  The attempts to escape nihilism without revaluing the former values  they produce the opposite  make the problem more acute    The Will to Power  no  28   Through us  the death of God creates a vacancy in the place of the highest values  The now vacant place of the hitherto highest values still belongs to the supersensory world  This incomplete nihilism posits  nothing  in the place of the highest values  It is incomplete in the sense that it still acknowledges and thus keeps a separation between the sensory and supersensory  In turn  this keeps a highest value in that sense   2   However  it is still a necessary step towards a fulfilling life not based on the supersensory world   The next step to a complete nihilism is an attempt at the revaluation of all values  subtitle of the  Will to Power    This means to say that one should take all values out of any other  world  into the scope of the sensory world in subjectivity  For subjectivity and value to be understood properly  it is important to briefly go over some crucial aspects of the will to power as it is how Nietzsche comes to understand value   The question then becomes  How one can lead a fulfilled life in the wake of this nihilism  It would have to be on the basis of the will to power as the fundamental driving force of life understood by Nietzsche  For the will to power  there is the will to more power which it sees as possibilities  This is part of the increase and the becoming which is in essence the will to power as described previously  For this  conditions are to be met in order for the will to obtain the possibilities as possible somethings of transitions to increase to  It is a necessary condition of possibilities to have the creation of possibilities and thus a condition of creation lies in the essence of the will to power as a necessary condition for increase in the same sense  This creation is for Nietzsche the essence of Art  As Heidegger puts it  The essence of art  grasped on the basis of the will to power  is the fact that art excites the will to power toward the will in the first place and spurs it to will above and beyond itself    Heidegger   Nietzsche s word  God is Dead  pg 180   Nietzsche then sees  value  as conditions for preservation increase with preservation increase belonging properly to the individual as willing the subject to individual evaluation  Subjectivity with respect to value  can be understood as seeing something in a way or a viewpoint  Therefore  with respect to the subjectivity of the will to power  values are seen from a viewpoint as conditions of the will to power in scope of the viewpoint of  the  will to power  The revaluation of all values then means that the values are now under the consideration of the will to power to see  subjectively  which are the  proper  conditions for preservation increase  Proper as in what the will to power sees as sufficient or necessary durables and durable to be obtained for preservation increase  preservation and increase    The next step is the transition from incomplete nihilism to complete nihilism or active nihilism  This is done via a new dispensation of values  This is also to say one has new values in mind  As stated previously  the revaluation of all values means that the values are under the consideration of the will to power to see  subjectively  which are the  proper  conditions for preservation increase  From this can come the new dispensation of values which are seen as conditions for preservation increase in the viewpoint of the will to power  This is in contrast to the pre devaluation dispensation of values where  God  in the supersensory sense holds its own value as the highest   Heidegger   Nietzsche s word  God is Dead  pg 167   3    For Heidegger  a Dasein  humankind of being  in everydayness is being in the world  This is living in accord with the they self or what y  do  It is opposed to coming to grips with its being in the world as for Heidegger it is anxious about its true self  With the coming to grips with being in the world  Dasein can step outside of being in the world and question the unauthenticity of the they self and can come to grips with being in its entirety and see the unauthenticity on a whole  Seeing that it is unauthentic one can bring themselves into scope with the horizon of being by stepping out by questioning and can possibly return from this stepping outside and can lead an authentic life  It can continue doing so by questioning its being in the world sense  This creation is for Nietzsche the essence of Art  As Heidegger puts it  The essence of art  grasped on the basis of the will to power  is the fact that art excites the will to power toward the will in the first place and spurs it to will above and beyond itself    Heidegger   Nietzsche s word  God is Dead  pg 180   It is then  for Nietzsche  that one can live a fulfilled life because of the will willing to go beyond itself to fulfill the possibilities created by art on the basis of the will to power  The will to power intrinsically contains the condition of art as a means of creating possibilities  It can become fulfilled for an instant as the possibilities created are reached but then comes out of fulfillment as the condition of art then creates new possibilities for the will to power to be reached  In this continual sense  a life lived in this way is in constant flux of fulfillment and thus is fulfilling   Since it is subjective  the will to power  through art can reach what it views as fulfilling in all possibilities such as a certain style to be developed  An appeal to a certain ideal as aesthetic becomes another possibility created by art   In one  sense  Heidegger would agree with this way to live a fulfilled life  The  way  articulated above is the devaluing of the highest values into the revaluation into the dispensation of new values with respect to the will to power and the new values as conditions of preservation increase to reach the possibilities created by art and being fulfilled when such possibilities are met  Heidegger agrees with this is in the sense that the revaluating of all values is likened to looking at metaphysics or looking at the horizon of being in its entirety   For Heidegger  a Dasein  humankind of being  in everydayness is being in the world  This is living in accord with the they self or what y  do  It is opposed to coming to grips with its being in the world as for Heidegger it is anxious about its true being With the coming to grips with being in the world  Dasein can step outside of being in the world and question the unauthenticity of the they self and can come to grips with being in its entirety and see the unauthenticity on a whole  Seeing that it is unauthentic one can bring themselves into scope with the horizon of being by stepping out by questioning and can possibly return from this stepping outside and can lead an authentic life  It can continue doing so by questioning its being in the world     3   In the text there is an initial dispensation value before the revaluation of values and then describes a further dispensation of values  I take the initial dispensation to be the dispensation of the values in the scope of the hitherto highest values not being authentic to oneself for Heidegger and for Nietzsche not living in accord with the new dispensation of values as conditions for the will to power  The stepping outside to grasp being in its entirety is for Nietzsche the revaluating of all values in the sense that they are both coming to grips with for Heidegger  being in its entirety and for Nietzsche  values in its entirety  The dispensation of new values in scope of the will to power after the completion of nihilism in order to reach the possibilities created by art can be likened to living an authentic life for Heidegger as they are both a type of subjective acknowledgment of their own essence and conditions for a fulfilling life   However  there is a fundamental difference in their thinking  This is in regard to Heidegger s view of Nietzsche s nihilism  For Heidegger  the supersensory world  God as such is also Metaphysics as he uses those word interchangeably in  Heidegger   Nietzsche s word  God is Dead   Heidegger thinks that for Nietzsche  nihilism being the highest values devaluing themselves is metaphysics depriving itself of its own possibilities to which he states   since metaphysics  through Nietzsche  has deprived itself of its own essential possibility in certain re spects  and therefore to that extent other possibilities of metaphysics can no longer become apparent    Heidegger   Nietzsche s word  God is Dead  pg 157   This for Nietzsche is a metaphysical reversal and is left in an inverted state of non essence  This  then for Nietzsche is the countermovement against metaphysics  However  Heidegger states that  as a mere countermovement  however  it necessarily remains trapped  like everything anti   in the essence of what it is challenging   Heidegger   Nietzsche s word  God is Dead  pg 162    This is to say that since it is going against metaphysics  as the horizon of being in its entirety  it becomes trapped and thus entangled in metaphysics with no way out   in fact  it is em broiled in it to such a degree that it is sealed off from its essence and  as metaphysics  is unable ever to think its own essence  This is the reason that  for and through metaphysics  there remains hidden what actually happens in and as metaphysics itself    Heidegger   Nietzsche s word  God is Dead  pg 162   In this sense  that the nihilistic reversal of metaphysics into non essence  is not possible in Heidegger s view which shows the fundamental difference in their thinking   Citations      Nietzsche   The Will to

these terms in my view describes passive and active nihilism as more a movement     2   For some this is  unbelief  in God in the place of the highest values     3   In the text there is an initial dispensation value before the revaluation of values and then describes a further dispensation of values  I take the initial dispensation to be the dispensation of the values in scope of the hitherto highest values,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/gws9dv/heideggers_attitude_towards_nietzches_death_of_god/

philosophy,2020-05-29 09:03:57,Disproving an Invalid Reality Theory  The CTMU,gsn76z,0,1,I would like to disprove the CTMU using some logical reasoning  But before I do  I ll say that I m glad I can contribute  To start off  the CTMU  Cognitive Theoretic Model of the Universe  says to be about using self determinism as a  middle ground  for solving the dichotomy of causal determinism and non determinism  Okay    But that s the flaw in it though  because self determinism is not a complete idea in and of itself  Clearly  it can be symmetrically mirrored to what is its dual in a higher dimension of causality  or to its dual in definition to self determinism   so to what is called outside the self determinism  making anti self determinism a real thing in possibility    But a  valid theory of determinism or of causality wouldn t be just combining a couple of old concepts into something else that is wrong just as well  in any case  Maybe though  a valid theory of causality could be about something called all determinism  but self determinism is simply wrong  it s incomplete as an idea    Notice how I don t deny that determinism and non determinism aren t completely related yet in standard reality theory  though  The CTMU says the same thing but then messes everything up  I d say  In other words  the M R principle in the CTMU is obviously false as a principle of reality BECAUSE the dualism of mind and reality is real in possibility just as much  It could actually be half of the real picture  though  Anyway  why else could I talk about it  if it wasn t real at all    Chris Langan is simply making what was originally a problem of dichotomy or lack of a relation between two things into an even bigger problem by heightening that same problem s complexity  It s like someone fused together Quantum Mechanical theory with Einstein s General Relativity  but only succeeded half of the way  But then  Langan also uses the CTMU to unfortunately disapprove of homosexuality for example  and he disapproves of atheists and democrats as well  all while disapproving of a bipartisan leadership    To explain a little further  the CTMU has to be wrong from its very basic premise of self determinism as formulating all of reality because the word  all  was replaced for  self   in the formulation of the CTMU being treated as a theory of everything  And  self   according to Langan  IS Langan  Also  conspansion is a false model of physical spacetime and is backwards thinking  Things must be expanding WHILE contracting in two symmetrical parallel universes if his idea is to work  as both are possibilities and one doesn t make sense without the other   but he denies universe expansion just as much as he denies externalized forms of determinism    I could even write a paper for a theory of everything that is far more valid than Langan s CTMU right now  too   about causality in dimensions Langan has probably never thought of  As for disproofs of the CTMU  however  I m just glad that I could contribute to what s on the internet right now  since no one else seems to be able to debunk the CTMU in an in depth  logically thorough way  Now  Langan is smart but he is simply wrong with the CTMU  Anyway  I ll leave this post at that  And I don t mean to attack Langan here  I respect him   but I do wish to disprove his theory with this,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/gsn76z/disproving_an_invalid_reality_theory_the_ctmu/
philosophy,2020-05-27 02:00:20,All philosophical models proposed to solve the logical problem of the Trinity are unsuccessful as they lead to heresy already identified within Church history  The principle of the twofoldness of divine truth is a better approach to understanding the Trinity and how to respond to the logical problem,gr7ppu,4,25, No introduction needed as title sets out purpose of post     Modalism    According to the modalistic concept of the Trinity  the Father  the Son  and the Holy Spirit are purely adjectival not equally and eternally co existent  but three successive manifestations of God  or three temporary modes of his activity  This denies that God in his own inner being is triune  Rather  it claims that the Father  Son  and Holy Spirit are either temporary or successive roles adopted by God in carrying out the divine plan of redemption and that they in no way correspond to anything in the ultimate nature of the Godhead  Chadwick  1968   Modalism does not recognize Christ s independent personality but sees his incarnation as a mode of the existence or manifestation of the Father  Bethune Baker  1929    Modalists hold the Father  Son and Spirit only refer to the way in which God reveals himself but bear no relation to his inner being  Bruce  1953   Sabellius  fl  ca  215  was  by far  the most original  profound  and ingenious of the modalists  Schaff  1950   His theology was essentially that of Noetus  Noetus taught that for Christ to be God  he had to be identical with the Father  Kelly 1960    but being more carefully worked out  a definite place being given to the Holy Spirit as well as to the Son  Walker  1959   Sabellius seems more concerned than those before him in preserving the unity of God  claiming strongly that God is one person as well as one substance  McGiffert 1931   Sabellius taught  the Father  Son and Holy Spirit are all one and the same  three different names of the one God who manifests himself in different ways according to circumstance  As the Father  he is Creator  Governor  and Lawgiver  as the Son  he is incarnate as the Redeemer  and as the Holy Spirit  he is the Inspirer of the Apostles  the Regenerator and the Sanctifier  Walker  1959     For Sabellius  he is the one and same God  the one and the same divine person  who acts out in all these ways  appearing in successive and temporary manifestations  the same way a human individual may have different titles to denote their various roles  Walker  1959    McGiffert 1931     God does not act as Father  Son and Spirit at the same time  but successively  turning from one activity to another as required  with one and the same God appearing now as the Father  now as the Son  and now as the Holy Spirit  but never all at the same time  Walker  1959    McGiffert 1931    Bethune Baker  1929     Crucial to Sabellius  thought is that God s unity unfolds itself in the course of the world s development in three periods of revelation  and after the fulfilment of redemption returns again into unity  Schaff  1950   His teaching was that the revelation of the Son ends with the ascension  and that the revelation of the Spirit continues in regeneration and sanctification  Schaff  1950   The Trinity of Sabellius is not a Trinity of essence  that is  of the inner being of God  but of revelation  Father  Son and Holy Spirit are simply designations of three different transitions under which the single divine essence reveals itself  Bethune Baker  1929   Sabellius differs from orthodox doctrine  the Father  Son and Holy Spirit being temporary phenomena  which have roles  after the completion of which led to a return of an abstract entity  Schaff  1950     Sabellius denied that the Father  Son  and Spirit eternally co exist in the inner being of God  Rather  he argued that the Father  Son  and Spirit are merely temporary and successive manifestations of the one person of God  In the words of J  F  Bethune Baker  expert in the history of doctrine  for Sabellius   there is no real incarnation  no personal indissoluble union of the Godhead with the manhood took place in Christ  God only manifested himself in Christ and when the part was played  and the curtain fell upon that act in the great drama there ceased to be a Christ or a Son of God   Bethune Baker  1929       Tritheism     As a sharp contrast to modalism  tritheism is the belief in three Gods  especially in the doctrine that the three persons of the Trinity are three distinct Gods  According to tritheism  the Father  Son  and Spirit are three separate Gods  Even today  some say that the Father is one God  that the Son is one God  and that the Spirit is also one God  This is tritheism  Latent tritheism is common among believers mainly due to the use of the word person  Speaking on this matter W  H  Griffith Thomas said     Like all human language  it is liable to be accused of inadequacy and even positive error  It certainly must not be pressed too far  or it will lead to tritheism  While we use the term to denote distinctions in the Godhead  we do not imply distinctions which amount to separateness  but distinctions which are associated with essential mutual co inherence or inclusiveness   Thomas  1930     It is the case talk of three persons in God often leads to understanding of three separate consciousness  spiritual vitalities centres of activity etc  This danger is increased by the fact discussion of person in scholarly works on the Trinity is derived from experience and philosophy  independent of the doctrine of the Trinity in revelation and history    A form of tritheism is represented by the doctrine of Arius  In Arius  formulation  the Father was fully God  the Son had the status of the leading creature  and the Spirit was inferior to the Son  Although for Arius the divine status of the Son and the Spirit was uncertain  his formula must be considered as a type of tritheism  Turner  1969   The teaching of Arius was controversial in the early decades of the fourth century  The controversy became so intense that at the invitation of the Emperor Constantine  the Council of Nicaea convened in 325 A D  to settle the dispute among the churches of the empire over the doctrine of the Trinity  The main issue was between Arius with his form of tritheism and Athanasius with the Trinity  The Nicene Creed that resulted from this council overthrew the heresy of Arius and tritheism with an anathema at the end of the creed  Gill  2019   The teaching of Arius aroused a great controversy in the early decades of the fourth century    By the time of the Council of Nicaea  both modalism  especially that of Sabellius  and tritheism had been defeated  However  since the time of Basil of Caesarea  Gregory of Nyssa  and Gregory of Nazianzus  A D  320 395   known as the three Cappadocians  there was a tendency toward tritheism  Because of this  more than two hundred years after the Nicene Council  drawing from the ultimate consequences of the Aristotelian logical terminology of the universal and particular another form of tritheism appeared in the teaching of Johannes Philoponus  who pushed the distinction between the Father  the Son  and the Spirit to an extreme  saying that there were three essences in the one common essence of the Godhead  This was virtually tritheism  Frank  1953    tritheistic tendencies are always never far from the Cappadocian doctrine of the hypostases  each of the three persons of the Trinity  as contrasted with the unity of the Godhead       Co inherence as a solution    Eventually the Fathers developed the doctrine of co inherence  which is the intercommunion and interpenetration of the persons of the Godhead  Co inherence denotes the mutual indwelling of the three persons whereby one is as invariably in the other two as they are in the one  Just as three sciences such as Physics  Biology and Chemistry interpenetrate each other  Physics fundamental grounds upon which Chemistry and then life Biology are built  entailing interpenetration at various levels of analysis  and God permeates the Universe  so much more each person interpenetrates the others  The key to this doctrine is mysticism  experience of God as Trinity subjectively   rather than the logic of the divine relations  Turner  1969     Co inherence is man s attempt to grasp the relationship between the three persons and to explain how they have one essence  John of Damascus wrote in his Exposition of the Orthodox Faith    the Son is in the Father and the Spirit  and the Spirit in the Father and the Son  and the Father in the Son and the Spirit  but there is no coalescence or co mingling or confusion   Damascene  749     Augustus H  Strong has argued on this matter that the Scripture s representations of this intercommunion make it difficult to conceive of the distinctions of Father  Son and Holy Spirit as entailing separation between them  The intercommunion explains Christs designation as the Spirit and the Spirit as the Spirit of Christ  Strong 1912   For Strong the persons of the Holy Trinity are therefore not separable individuals  each involving the other  the coming of each the coming of the others  This means the coming of the Spirit involved the coming of the Son  Strong 1912   The doctrine of co inherence  therefore  avoids the extremes of modalism and tritheism     The Logical problem of the Trinity    Having outlined the extremes of modalism and tritheism and laid out co inherence as the way to avoid these extremes I will now turn to the logical problem of the Trinity  Within the Athanasian Creed  the following three theological theses on God as Trinity can be found     1  We worship God in Trinity and Trinity in Unity    Neither confounding the persons nor dividing the substance    2  So the Father is God  the Son is God  and the Holy Spirit is God    3  And yet they are not three Gods  but one God   Molto  2017    The logical problem that arises from this can be characterized in the following way    1 Each person of the Trinity is distinct from each of the others    2 Each person of the Trinity is God   3 There is exactly one God   Craig  2005      These three together have the implication that three distinct beings are identical with one being  which is incoherent  A series of strategies to overcome this incoherence  from the social  constitution and psychological models of the Trinity will now be assessed     The social model of the Trinity    In the gospels  the first two persons of the Trinity are referred to as Father and Son  Social Trinitarians have argued this suggests the analogy of a family  As a solution to the logical problem of the Trinity they claim the persons of the Trinity might be thought of as one in the same way the members of a family are one  they are three individual human beings but taken together they are a single family  McCall  2010   I find this line of thought unpersuasive   for one thing the relation between Father and Son is more than just familial  it denotes a role which entails the other s existence   the Father cannot be a Father without the Son and the Son cannot be the Son without the Father  Furthermore  any family unit one can give as an example  contains members which are not only distinct but also separate  separate consciousness will emotion etc  from one another  thinking of the persons of the Trinity as separate from one another in the same way members of a family are will lead to either latent or explicit tritheism  It also falls short in securing unity amongst the persons of the Trinity  there are versions of polytheism such the children of Chronos in Greek mythology  of whom Zeus was the liberator  and these children included Zeus  Hera  Ares  and other Olympian deities all members of a divine family  Nobody thinks that this divine family can be thought of as one God though  McCall  2010    Advancing beyond this social Trinitarians have noted other relations that hold between members of the Trinity that contribute alongside there being members of a single divine family to their counting as one  Richard Swinburne has argued several facts in conjunction with one another is enough to secure unity amongst the divine persons  They share the essential characteristics of divinity  omniscience  omnipotence  omnibenevolence and so forth  There is also the relation between the persons  wills being necessarily harmonious  so that they never conflict with one another and the perfect love with necessary mutual interdependence amongst the divine persons  Mutual dependence is taken by Swinburne to be equivalent to co inherence  Swinburne therefore holds that there is one God because the community of divine persons are so closely interconnected  that  although there are three distinct persons they function as if they were a single entity  McCall  2010     Swinburne takes it as far as to claim that there are three  rather than only one  divine individuals  Marilyn McCord Adams has described his thought here as follows  three numerically distinct souls of the Divine essential kind  each instantiating the universal Divinity  each inevitably everlasting but individuated from one another by relations of origin   Adams  2006   On this perspective it is the same essence of divinity that makes the Father  Son and Spirit all God   1      Swinburne  1994     What I take to be a key issue with Swinburne s model is its assumption that mutual dependence is equivalent to co inherence which is false  co inherence also entails the Father  Son  and Spirit inseparably and mutually indwell each other  not just a relation of interdependence  As Bishop Bull has said on the matter of co inherence  The co inherence of the Divine Persons is indeed a very great mystery  which we ought rather religiously to adore than curiously pry into    It is a union which far transcends all other unions   Bull 1851   Swinburne s attempt to reduce co inherence to mere mutual dependence  I therefore find insufficient  and as such think it is unsuccessful in allowing one to identify as Trinitarian and Monotheist at the same time    Stephen T Davis s social Trinitarian approach of recognizing co inherence as mutual indwelling  interpenetrating and merging has more merit  however Davis more readily recognises the Trinity is at bottom mysterious  beyond philosophical rigour to capture in doing so  McCall  2016   The model also has a short falling as it relies solely on co inherence to ward off accusations of tritheism  however co inherence is not the sole way that the three of the Trinity operate  there is also the role of incorporation  Incorporation accommodates the mutual existence  mutual indwelling  and mutual operation in the immanent existence and in the economic activity of the three persons of the Trinity  Incorporation therefore sees the work of the three as inseparable to accomplish what is distinct to one person alone  the carrying out of the divine economy via action of the three by what they are and what they do meaning that when one acts they incorporate the operations of the other two in manifest action  This means each can be identified with the other with no compromising of the eternal distinction among them  Lee  1996     An instance of incorporation is that the second person of the Trinity the Son was crucified and resurrected from the dead  not the Father or the Spirit  however it is the case that the Father and Spirit were not separate from Christ still operating in him as he was crucified  Christ offers himself through the Spirit  entailing the Son in himself could not accomplish his crucifixion  the Spirit one with the Son who died on the cross with the Father and by the Spirit  The death of Christ was not only the death of the man Jesus but the death of the Son with the Father and by the Spirit  The scriptures testify both that the Father and the Spirit raised the Son on the third day  however  they also testify that the Son rose from the dead  This recognises two things  in his humanity God raised Jesus from the dead  whereas from the consideration of him as God we are informed  he himself rose from the dead  The crucifixion and resurrection of Christ is therefore an operation of the entire Trinity which is divinely incorporated  Lee 1990   the co inherence and incorporation of the Trinity far beyond the ability of these models to capture   Swinburne s model also fails in capturing the oneness in expression and function of the Triune God which goes beyond mere aligning of will or indivisibility for logical reasons between the persons   as the scriptures identify that one is another and the three are used interchangeably in relation to man s experience of God  God relates to man in a threefold manner  not a collective entity which makes the Trinity  but the Trinity itself  freely and gratuitously communicated  Brian Leftow has criticised Swinburne s model similarly on the grounds of worship as it only makes sense if directed to someone who is aware of being addressed  however collections are not conscious so one cannot worship Swinburne s collective save as a way to worship its members  McCall  2010     It also requires a commitment to the belief that the Son exists in the same way that creatures exist  only due to the Father conserving him in being and not ending him  This is because Swinburne views each person of the Trinity as a discrete substance  distinct being  even when he sees the Son as casually dependent on the Father  Moreland and Craig note that as the Son is viewed as a distinct substance from the Father  the Father s begetting the Son therefore amounts to a creation ex nihilo  which as Arius claimed makes the Son a creature  Craig and Moreland 2003   This is wholly inadequate as in the Gospel of John the relationship between the Son and the Father can be seen  For example  in John 1 14  the only Begotten from the Father  the Greek word for  from  is παρὰ  para   which means by the side of  implying with hence  it is  literally  from with  Strong  1890   This means that the Son not only is from God but also is with God  On the one hand  he is from God  and on the other hand  he is still with God  This is contrary to Swinburne s understanding of the Son existing due to the Father conserving him and not ending him    As for the unity of will among the three divine persons on this model  this does not support Trinitarianism for three separate Gods who were each omnipotent and morally perfect would similarly act cooperatively  so Swinburne s reasoning can lead one to conclude tritheism just as easily as Trinitarianism  Craig and Moreland  2003   Swinburne may respond to this critique  that this concern is dealt with by the Farther being the source of the other persons ensuring a guaranteed coordination in their wills  whereas if they were three Gods there could be two equally optimal  mutually exclusive ways of proceeding  wherein one God might will one way  while another differently  My concern with this response is that until a specific example can be given  or possible world constructed wherein this takes place  such a possibility must be disregarded and therefore one has to assume the God s having the same nature and attributes would lead to them acting cooperatively  Craig and Moreland even go as far as to claim that if Swinburne s arguments against the possibility of dissension are correct this must be so  Craig and Moreland  2003    Other social Trinitarians have attempted to give different accounts of what unifies the divine persons  One such account is the part whole model   2     C S  Lewis s version of this analogy has it that God is three Persons while remaining one Being  just as a cube is six squares while remaining one cube  J  P  Moreland and William Lane Craig have argued that the relation between the persons of the Trinity can be thought of as analogous to the relation we might suppose to obtain between the three dog like beings that compose Cerberus  the mythical guardian of the underworld  Each of the three heads  or each of the three souls associated with the heads is a fully canine individual  and yet there is only one being  Cerberus  with the full canine nature  three persons of a type  and still one dog  McCall 2010     There are two main issues with this approach  first  like with Swinburne and Davis s accounts it does not get one to the co inherence  incorporation and oneness in expression and function of the triune God as a whole that is needed amongst the divine persons to avoid the extremes of modalism and tritheism  More significantly it would lead one to think that there were three essences in the one common essence of the Godhead as was with the teaching of Johannes Philoponus   3     leading to latent or explicit tritheism  Lewis s cube example is also problematic  for one thing a cube is a seventh thing in addition to its six sides  but God cannot be thought of as a fourth thing in addition to his triune nature  Murray and Rea  2012      The Psychological Model    Looking to the human mind or  psyche  has also been sought to help understand the doctrine of the Trinity  Augustine proposed that the oneness and threeness of the Godhead is like the oneness and threeness of the human self  Augustine claimed the oneness of the Father  Son and Holy Spirit is like the oneness of the mind  thoughts   heart  emotions  and will of a person  Augustine therefore holds we cannot have intellectual insight of the Trinity directly and that the created human mind which is made  in the image and likeness of God  as seen in Genesis 1 26 28  is a reflection of the Trinity  More extensively the mind is seen as somehow corresponding to the Father  Son and Holy Spirit in the following ways    lover  loved object  the lover s love for that object   the mind  its knowledge  its love   the mind s remembering itself  understanding itself  and willing itself   memory  understanding  and will   the mind s remembering God  understanding God  and willing God   existing  knowing that one exists  loving the fact that one exists   Tuggy 2016    These are taken to be pictures of the Trinity  the last three being more accurate  however when it comes to representing God Augustine holds them to be  immeasurably inadequate   Tuggy 2016    There is a major problem with Augustine s line of thought  the Father  Son and Spirit are three distinct persons  not three distinct aspects of one person  The mind  heart and will are three aspects of the human soul  the three of the Trinity are distinct yet inseparable  the same yet different  The danger here is modalistic Monarchianis if Augustine s analogy is taken to its extreme implications  like all analogies it breaks down  and it is at this point imo   As Adolf Harnack  has said on the matter   we can see that Augustine only gets beyond modalism by the mere assertion that he does not wish to be a modalist  and by the aid of ingenious distinctions between different ideas   Harnack 1976   Furthermore  Harnack draws attention to the fact Augustine held the view that the Godhead is personal and is consequently one person  being unable to overcome the contradiction in affirming the three persons in one essence at the same time  Harnack 1976    Thomas V  Morris has claimed we can find an analogy for the Trinity in the psychological condition multiple personality disorder  just as a single human being can have multiple personalities  so too can God be one yet exist in three persons  Others have advocated the view we can conceive of the divine persons with an analogy of the separate spheres of consciousness that result from commissurotomy  This is a procedure sometimes used to treat epilepsy and involves the cutting of the corpus callosum by which the two hemispheres of the brain communicate  Under certain kinds of conditions  they display psychological characteristics that suggest they have two distinct spheres of consciousness  associated with the two hemispheres of their brain  This analogy is used to demonstrate that just as one human being can have two distinct spheres of consciousness  so too the one God can exist in three persons  each of which is a distinct sphere of consciousness  Murray and Rea  2012    What merit there is in being able to present real life cases to help solve the logical problem of the Trinity must be dismissed as this understanding will lead to either latent or explicit modalism  In both examples given there is multiple personalities or spheres of consciousness within one person  but these personalities and spheres are not co existent  rather they are mere manifestations  With multiple personality disorder the different personalities are all temporary  each one ending as a different one emerges  and with the distinct spheres of consciousness they only emerge temporarily under certain experimental conditions  This would lead us to understand the Trinity as merely three successive manifestations of God  which is modalism   4     the co existence  and co inherence of the divine persons in one another required for the Trinity not being met with this model  Another interpretation is that each of the hemispheres sustains its own stream of consciousness  co existing with one another  This would lead to latent or explicit tritheism as the consciousness would be separate from one another  despite being grounded in one person  whereas the persons of the Trinity are inseparable yet distinct      The Constitution Model    Another solution proposed is that of relative sameness  This argues that things can be the same relative to one kind of thing  but distinct relative to another  More formally    Relative Sameness  It is possible that there are x  y  F  and G such that x is an F  y is an F  x is a G  y is a G  x is the same F as y  but x is not the same G as y   Murray and Rea  2012    If this claim is true  then it is open to us to say that the Father  Son  and Holy Spirit are the same God but distinct persons  Advocates have suggested that reflection on cases of material constitution for example statues and the lumps of matter that constitute them  help us see how two things can be the same material object but otherwise different entities  If right then  by analogy  such thought can also help us to see how Father  Son  and Holy Spirit are the same God yet three different persons   Consider the Bronze statue The Thinker  It is a single material object  but it can described as both a statue  which is one kind of thing  and as a lump of bronze which is another kind of thing  The statue is also distinct form the lump of Bronze  For example  if the statue were melted down  we would no longer have both a lump and a statue  the lump would remain though in a different shape  but Rodin s Thinker would no longer exist  This suggests an intuition that the lump is something distinct from the statue  as they can exist apart from another only if they are distinct  If correct  then this is not a case in which something appears in two different ways or is referred to by two different labels it is a case in which two distinct things occupy the same region of space time  By analogy the Father  Son  and Holy Spirit are the same God but different persons in just the way a statue and its constitutive lump are the same material object but different form matter compounds  Murray and Rea  2012    As Daniel Molto has concluded in his defence of a logic of strong relative identity  there has to be a utilization of logic in which absolute  universally reflexive  identity does not occur as a primitive and cannot be introduced by definition  This leads to a rejection of the relation of identity  and in particular giving up Leibniz s Law  It is also necessary to give up on any semantic account  which attaches absolutely individuated values to terms  This means giving up the possibility of genuine singular reference  Molto  2017    The fundamental problem with the appeal to relative identity  however  is that relative identity is widely seen as problematic  For one thing one cannot give an example other than the Trinity where allegedly relative identities cannot be analysed in terms of classical identity  With the example of the Thinker statue there is not an identity statement at all  for the Thinker is not literally a lump of Bronze rather it has a property of bronze  It is also the case that the lump of bronze is more fundamental than the statue  persisting whatever shape the bronze assumes whereas the statue will not  This entails that the statue is a manifestation of one kind of the underlying reality  hence the example is inadequate for providing a model of the Trinity  Furthermore  suppose that two things x and y could be the same N but could not be the same P  In this case x could not fail to be the same P as x itself  but y could  Therefore  x and y are discernible meaning they cannot be the same thing  This means that they cannot be the same N  since they cannot be the same anything  identity must therefore be absolute  Craig and Moreland  2003    Theologically there are issues too as it commits one to a part whole relation  also problematic for Lewis s social Trinitarianism  within the Trinity wherein no one person is identical to the whole Trinity  Craig and Moreland  2003   This therefore entails the claim that no one person of the Trinity is fully God  As already presented though co inherence and incorporation entail just this claim and give explanation for scriptures identifying each person as the other  This gives the basis for the Eleventh Council of Toledo affirming   Each single person is wholly God in Himself    the Athanasian Creed   to acknowledge every Person by himself to be God and Lord    and the Fourth Lateran Council that   each of the Persons is that reality  viz   that divine substance  essence  or nature       what the Father is  this very same reality is also the Son  this the Holy Spirit   Craig and Moreland  2003    A key example from the scriptures is Colossians 2 9 which says  in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily  indicating the Son is therefore the fullness of the Godhead  God himself   the fullness here denoting God s very essence  which is his substance  This refers not just to the entirety of the triune God  but all that the triune God  is  has  does  knows  can do  has done  has obtained  has accomplished  and has attained   Lee  1987   As the divine Trinity is the fullness of the Godhead this makes Christ the mystery of God  Lee 1983   confirmed in Colossians 2 2 which says   The mystery of God  Christ   He is the mystery of the Word of God in eternity past as seen in John 1 1 which says   In the beginning was the Word  and the Word was with God and the Word was God   This word of God became flesh  divinity and humanity joined to form a God man  the mysterious divinity being brought into humanity  the mysterious fullness of the Godhead which dwells bodily in this mysterious God man  Lee 1963  being far beyond the comprehension of human reason  and ability of a philosophical model to capture     The Twofoldness of Divine Truth    Having assessed the most popular models of the Trinity intended to solve the logical problem of the Trinity and found them at best unpersuasive and at worst opening the possibility to heresy   5     I will now present an alternative approach  Modalism and tritheism stress in an unbalanced way one aspect of the twofold truth of God s revelation in the Bible  Modalism takes one aspect of the truth   that there is only one God  and pushes it to a heretical extreme  tritheism  takes another aspect of the truth of God s revelation  that he is one in three  and pushes it to the opposite heretical extreme  If we see the principle of the twofoldness of divine truth  we can easily avoid these extremes and still maintain a testimony faithful to the whole truth of God s revelation in the Scriptures   Robert Govett  1813 1901  was a British theologian  influenced by the Plymouth Brethren  who authored the principle in his work  The Twofoldness of Divine Truth   The work is not widely read having but has played a significant role in the teaching of Watchman Nee and Witness Lee  which entailed reading in China due to a Watchman Nee translation of the work into Chinese  Lee 1991  and still holds influence among strains of the Brethren  As such it is a work that has not been engaged with by western Christian Philosophers  and it s important to note the context for the work is one wherein divisions were being formed within the church by various denominations taking the extreme of either side of a matter of truth   6       Govett speaks on this twofoldness saying  The twofoldness of truth as offered to our view in Holy Writ is one strong argument of its not being the work of man  It is the glory of man s intellect to produce oneness  It is to trace different results to one principle  to clear it of ambiguities  to show how  through varied appearances  one law holds  Anything that stands in the way of the completeness of this  he eludes or denies   Govett  undated     But   as Govett continues   it is not so with God  In nature he is continually acting with two seemingly opposed principles    Govett  undated   Examples Govett gives of this are the two forces that keep planets moving in order around the sun  being two forces pulling each particle of matter in two opposite directions at the same instant  leave it to one of them and the Earth would fly away into space  to the other it would be drawn down to the surface of the sun  Another is how life is supported by two airs or gases of opposite qualities  to breath one of them alone we would die in a few minutes  but together life is sustained  He notes even the salt eaten by humans is a compound of two substances  either of which alone would destroy us  Govett  undated   Of importance is the fact Govett s examples still hold true to this day  and there are even more that science has discovered since his time  Of important note is that Govett s examples don t have incoherence of the kind presented by the logical problem of the Trinity  rather they demonstrates our inability to reduce the laws governing nature into a single underlying principle or law clear of ambiguities  there is not a single law governing nature but ones wherein two forces or developments in opposition harmoniously and wondrously work alongside one another    There are therefore two distinct cases of twofoldness  cases wherein there are two opposed principles which cannot be reduced to a single underlying principle which operate in the world and cases wherein there are two opposed principles which cannot be reduced to a single underlying principle where we cannot grasp how they operate in the world  The examples that one can produce from our scientific study of nature largely take on the form of the first case  whereas from study of the scriptures examples from the second  The primary reason for this is that the realm of scientific and biblical require different tools for engagement  the sciences being grasped through mind  whereas the biblical is grasped via the spirit  For Govett we can experience God as Trinity  however we cannot grasp how it is God is Trinity in our mind  whereas with the natural realm of science we can both experience  via experimentation for deeper realms  and grasp it in our mind    More recent examples of twofoldness arising from the sciences are the fundamental opposition of general relativity  GR  and quantum mechanic  QM   The Final Contradiction  undated  and several forces within nature working in opposition to each other such as the strong nuclear force and weak nuclear force acting and balancing each other  the cosmological constant acting as a repulsive force in space time balanced by the Higgs Field and the balance between matter and antimatter in the universe  Hainline  2015    These examples from nature give the account merit in that twofoldness within nature is evidence of the twofoldness of the Trinity as it raises its probability relative to what it would be otherwise  It also gives the account predictive power in the following two ways  it predicts that scientists will not be able to reduce instances of two opposed principles or laws to an underlying principle or law within nature  and that the number of examples one can cite of opposing principles or laws within nature increases as our scientific knowledge of the world grows  For the purpose of this post however it is more important that the twofoldness holds in the scriptures as it will support a Govettian reading as well as ensuring the failure of alternatives  Presenting the twofoldness in the scripture and producing an inductive argument alongside the twofoldness in creation in favour of it  and then defending the argument from possible objections will now therefore follow      Twofoldness in the Word    Discussing the matter of twofoldness  Govett says   It is not then to be wondered at  if two seemingly opposed principles are found placed side by side in the Scripture   Unity in plurality  plurality in unity  is the main principle on which both the world and the Scripture are constructed   Govett  undated   Regarding the apparently irreconcilable statements in God s Word  Govett remarks   It is not necessary to reconcile them before we are bound to receive and act upon the two  It is enough that the Word of God distinctly confirms them both   Govett  undated   As Govett says   The claim on our reception is not that we can unite them  but that God has testified both   Govett  undated   Many debates regarding the truth in God s Word are unnecessary  for  as Govett states   Opposite views of truth arise from different parts of the subject being viewed at different times   Govett  undated   In relation to revelation Govett says   Thus does God try His people  will they trust him when He affirms that view of truth which runs counter to their temperaments and intellectual bias  or will they trample on one of His sayings in their zeal for the other  The humble  child like saint will acknowledge and receive both  for his Father  who cannot err  testifies to each alike   Govett  undated     Applying the principle to the nature of God Govett wrote   The same twofoldness of truth appears in the Scripture statements concerning the nature of God  It affirms His unity    But the Scripture as plainly affirms the distinction of persons in the Godhead   Unity in plurality and plurality in unity  is the assertion here  This master truth  which takes its rise in the nature of the Godhead  flows out into all His works   Govett  undated    Note Govett s statement that this  master truth   takes its rise in the nature of the Godhead   In other words  God s revelation in the Scriptures  being twofold  is an expression of the very nature of God himself  The two aspects of God s being   that he is the Three being one and the One being three   are testified by the twofoldness of the truth of his revelation in the Scriptures  Examples given in the wider scripture of the principle include God s Sovereignty and Man s Responsibility   The Extent of Redemption  The Perseverance of the Believers  Justification by Faith or by Works  The Character of God  The Nature of the Saviour  Christ s divine and human nature    The Status of the Saviour  Worship  Means of Edification  The Spirit of Worship  The Means of Grace  The Church  The Dispensations of God  and The Word of God    continuing in comments

philosophy,2020-05-26 18:41:57,The Proudhon Bastiat Debate  1849 1850  Reconstruction and critical appraisal of Bastiat s argument in favor of rent interest,gqzecr,11,9,In  Capitale et Rente   Bastiat attempts to establish the legitimacy of interest rent  Bastiat asks us to consider three separate scenarios  the first involving a farmer named Mathurin  the second  a house maker named Mondor  and the third  a tool maker named Jacques  Each one of these workers is said to toil day and night  the first producing a bag of wheat  the second a house  and the third  a plane  Each one is said to be intent on making use of the thing created immediately after completion  When  after much hardship  these workers complete their respective projects  a personage rudely intervenes and demands to use the tool for the period of one year  without offering the worker any compensation for the loss of the tool besides promising to return the tool in exactly the same condition within a year   These scenarios serve a specific purpose within the context of his argument  Indeed  after reading each scenarios  one is left with the intuitive sense that the worker  whether it be Mathurin  Mondor or Jacques  has been treated unfairly  perhaps even deeply disrespected  After all  it is at precisely the moment when the worker is about to collect the benefits conferred upon them by their tool that access to the tool is abruptly cut off and that the benefits of the tool are conferred upon another person   one who is both undeserving and selfish  Undeserving because they played no part whatsoever in the creation of the tool  and opportunistically request access to the tool the moment it is about to be put to use by its creator  Selfish because they deny the maker of the product access to the benefits which flow from their labor  depriving the maker of the very advantages which motivated them to create the thing in the first place  I think it is fair to say   and this  I believe is what Bastiat is counting on   that anyone reading these scenarios will find it all but natural that the worker be compensated for the loss of the benefits to which they are now being denied access  compensation which must reach beyond the simple returning of the thing being borrowed  It is this sense of moral indignation which accompanies the  privation  of the worker that Bastiat mobilizes in order to establish the legitimacy of rent   Bastiat s scenarios are misleading because they are not structurally similar to the capitalist relation under consideration  a relation which necessarily involves a single individual   the capitalist   who has at his disposal more tools than he can  on his own  make full productive use of  His scenarios misleadingly cast the capitalist as someone   indeed  a worker    who is always already in a position to reap the advantages of all of the means of production at his disposition  even  and perhaps  especially before  the worker s  make s  their appearance  Bastiat  1849  p  47   And yet  part of what makes the capitalist  a capitalist   as Proudhon explicitly points out  is precisely the fact that he has at his disposal more tools than he can possibly make full productive use of  Proudhon  1849  p  125   The capitalist is never therefore  someone who experiences privation as a result of lending  he is instead always someone who has more means than he can make use of and is therefore well positioned to lend  Bastiat s use of scenarios that cast the capitalist as one who is deprived  and consequent attempt to evoke within us a sense of moral indignation  is therefore nothing more than a sly trick   one that covers up the very specificity of the capitalist relation   What we are interested in knowing is whether or not  when one has at one s disposition more tools than one can make use of  one may legitimately demand compensation from those who borrow   beyond simple restitution   Bastiat s scenarios  cannot  because of their structural dissimilarity with capitalist relations  provide us any reason to believe so  For what motivates our  yes  to this question after reading Bastiat s scenarios is the  privation  experienced by the worker  and we have shown that the capitalist  by definition  is someone who experiences no privation because he can afford to lend  Proudhon s answer to this question is a resounding  no  and his argument for why this is has much intuitive appeal   If  in lending out the things or means of production at one s disposition  one experiences no privation  and if the act of lending comes at no additional cost  then this act of lending is a service which we might well provide free of charge  provided of course that the person who borrows promises restitution  Proudhon  1849  p  152   Though Proudhon doesn t go so far as to say that we might actually have the  obligation  to lend our capital free of charge when doing so comes at no extra cost to ourselves  my sense is that an argument defending this claim could quite easily be made  Indeed  if one has more than one needs  more than one can productively make use of  it seems quite natural that one should allow others with less to make use of what one has  especially when this comes at no cost to oneself    Works Cited   Bastiat  Frédéric   2015   Capitale et Rente  Dans  Oeuvres complètes de Frédéric

philosophy,2020-05-25 05:44:02,Current Arguments against Determinism  and in Favour of Free Will ,gq2wm8,5,37,To begin with  I d like to say that  for whatever  possibly predetermined   P  reason  I find myself struggling against the idea of determinism and wanting to believe in free will  Yet whenever I think things through  I end up siding with determinism   I ve read some threads on both topics on here  but they often turned into debates about whether or not the term being discussed should be about free will or about control  or some other digression  Or someone used the argument that because something happened  it always had to happen  so that was proof of determinism   end of story  I thought I d start a post here and just get some responses  which I fully plan to interact with  to see what kind of information I might pick up from the knowledgeable community here   To begin with  and you may prefer other terms  but let s try not to argue semantics  if possible   what I mean when I want to discuss determinism versus free will  is not whether or not we are free to do as we want  but whether or not we  have control  to do those things   Whenever I think this through  I always come back to determinism  but I can t tell if my thinking  proves  determinism  or if it falls under the category of some sort of almost circular reasoning fallacy or post hoc fallacy   So when discussing the idea of free will and control  I might start by considering any action  Let s say I m deciding whether to read a book or listen to a record  and I decide to read a book   The determinist argument I d like to deal with posits that I chose to read a book because of all the circumstances in history that lead to that moment  socially  physically  mentally  and so on  Everything is a form of causality leading backward through time   I m only choosing between those 2 things because I bought those items  I only bought them because I encountered the author and artist previously  I liked or was interested in their work because of other work I d seen so that I could fit this work into a framework I had previously developed and that led to my interest  Even further back  the only reason I like reading at all is because my parents read to me when I was younger  and I enjoy records because my grandfather used to play them whenever I visited  The only reason I can afford those items is because I was born into a middle class family  received a university degree  and got a middle class job myself  And on and on   I m sure you know the argument  Everything that came before led me to that moment  every action and thought caused by the prior event  so that when I eventually decided to read that book  it was the only choice I could make   At this point  you often get the assertion that because I chose to read the book  and it was an event in this long chain of causality that led to it  the fact that I  did  make this choice proves that it was the only choice I could make  For some reason  I never see anyone argue against that  And maybe it s correct   To me  though  that seems like an example of using a result in a sample size of one to prove something with 100  certainty  It doesn t work for me    So at that point  I start to think  okay  maybe I still have free will  Maybe the environmental and genetic factors in my history led me to that moment  but that I shouldn t see things so black and white  Maybe I was viewing this too much as either or  as in at that point I chose one option with 100  probability and the other option with 0   Maybe those environmental and genetic factors put me in a position where there was a sliding scale of chance  not 100 0  but maybe 70  likelihood I d choose a record and 30  I d choose a book  maybe that day I had a bit of eye strain from being on the computer at work too much  plus whatever other factors  so the odds were a bit in favour of listening to music   Just because something  did  happen  doesn t meant there was 100  certainty it  would  happen  That feels too much to me like rolling a 6 and then saying there was 100  chance I would roll that  rather than a 1 in 6 chance   But then when we take this further  let s say causality led to a percentage likelihood of one of the choices occurring  70 30 let s say   Fine  but then what leads to the actual decision between them  Well  again  even if there is a set of odds for the choice  there are only 2 options I see that end up resulting in the final choice  chance  and or my conscious being   If chance had something to do with it  that s outside of anything that can really be proven  So I will set this aside for now  but if anyone has anything interesting to add about how it may factor in  I d be interested to hear it  I m not sure if chance playing a roll would lead to determinism or indeterminsm  to be honest   The second option  however  leads me back toward determinism  If I choose between the options and decide to read a book  it seems like I ve chosen against the 70 30 odds I presented in this hypothetical situation earlier  It  feels  as if I ve somehow beaten determinism and make a truly free choice  How refreshing   But  of course  I haven t  because I only make that choice because of a combination of how my brain works  genetics   the knowledge I ve accumulated up to that point  etc etc etc  So  in effect  the very nature of who I am  internally  is the result of the same causality we discussed earlier that led to the  external  circumstances  Sure  I feel as though I built myself into who I am and how I think  but every choice I made along the way was subject to the same causality and determinism that the circumstances around me owning the book and record were   In the end  it seems that the external circumstances around me and that choice  and the internal circumstances of who I am in that moment when I make the choice  are all predetermined   So whatever choice I make is the mathematical conclusion of those things    At this point  the only part of this equation that I can see that might not be deterministic  is chance  And that s not an answer I particularly love either  because who wants to go in search of feeling like they have free will  only to find out that either a  everything is the result of determinism s causality  or b  maybe there s some random chance in there as well  which is just as much out of our control   Yet here we are   So after all of this  I have a few questions  probably in order of my level of interest   1  Does anyone have any arguments against this type of determinism  in favour of free will  or personal control   2  If not  how do you stop yourself from falling into some sort of existential crisis  If none of your choices matter  because you could have never done anything other than what you did  so even acts of kindness mean nothing other than you just following through with what you were always going to do  how do you find peace and or happiness with that  3  Do you think that the action having occurred proves that action was 100  always going to be taken  therein proving determinism  If so  please explain  If not  but you still believe in determinism  what is your argument for it   Finally  I see that questions belong in askphilosophy  but I did develop a position and my questions is just asking for responses to it  which is what I assume is usually the result of a post here  so perhaps that s acceptable   Thanks in advance  I m looking forward to having some engaging discussion

philosophy,2020-05-23 08:54:26,Why I m no longer a realist about the physical world,gozsni,15,51,I m 32  I completed honours in philosophy a decade ago  But just in the last two weeks  I ve been converted to a form of idealism  by a paper written in 1948 that is only now getting some attention because it was published this year by the author s descendants  link below   Here is my version of the argument that has converted me   1   My so called empirical knowledge is knowledge only of sensory information  AKA perception  sensory experiences  ideas  that I am conscious of   2   My belief in a large category of things existing beyond this sensory information  and described by it  is epistemically justified iff that category of things explains the sensory information more reasonably than an explanation that doesn t commit me to the existence of that category of things  in order words  if I m going to postulate things I don t have direct knowledge of they have to earn their keep    3   My knowledge of sensory information  my conscious experiences  is as reasonably explained by Fleming s rule based idealism   4   Therefore  I am not epistemically justified in assuming this sensory information reveals the existence of objects and events in the physical world  there independently of us   5   Therefore  I am only justified in believing in the existence of my experiences ideas   What has changed for me is my inference to the best explanation in 3  I thought my realism about the physical world was earning its keep  What could be more natural  The independent existence of an external world is such an inference of habit and commonsense that it s hard to stand back and actually question it  When I could bring myself to question it fully  I still found it extremely hard to resist for three reasons    Objects appear to me or are available to my experience independently of my will or choice  unlike the recollection of a place  for example    Our sensory experiences are ordered  predictable and able to repeated according to what we call laws of nature   Because things tend to have causes  we should expect there to be objects behind our sensory information causing us to receive it   These observations are so basic and reinforced in our every experience and seem to lead so enviably to realism about the physical world that how could any alternative theory hope to compete  The narrator in Fleming s story offers us such a theory  Each of these three observations instincts he is able to either dispel or reconcile with his form of idealism  which I m calling rule based idealism  Don t accuse me of trying to claim naming rights over it   I just have to call it something  given the author didn t  He was busy writing a quirky story about it    So how does the theory go  The best way I can describe this kind of idealism is  incidentally  the same way I describe my job as a software developer working on role playing PC games  In my line of work  we place an agent in a  soft  world which they can navigate as if it has an existence of its own  And it does have an existence of its own  But only as code  which is essentially a set of rules   If the agent is in condition W  location X and does Y  Z happens and so on   Even a game operating on very simple algorithms can create an illusion comparable on its principles to our waking lives according to this rule based idealism   Which explanation for my sensory information requires the greater ontological commitment  Between the two  I agree with Fleming that the idealism is considerably more parsimonious than physical realism  That means that physical realism needs to be able to offer something pretty useful in return  Reading the paper has left me with no idea what that could possibly be  It now seems fairly clear to me that none of the three observations above actually make the independent existence of a physical world more likely than Fleming s rule based idealism  The character defending this view is less ontologically committed than his interlocutor  champion of commonsense  and yet in no way disadvantaged in making sense of his environment  so to speak   For example  he still wants  and can explain his desire  to turn off his headlights before they drain his car battery even though he denies his car exists as anything more than the sensory experiences he labels  my car    The most significant possible problem with this kind of argument is that it appears to back us into a corner that begins to look like solipsism or scepticism about the external world  including other minds   It risks being marginalised as an extreme or impractical position  Maybe it is a bit extreme in itself  But I view Fleming s rule based idealism as a kind of foundation or starting point from which I can  for example  make allowance for other conscious beings whose conscious experiences interact with my own according to the same rules that govern my own  This is not a commitment to a new kind of stuff   just more  ideas     At the very least  I suggest we owe it to ourselves to seriously question what we gain by our realism about the physical world when we can manage surprisingly well without it  That is what has come as such a shock to me  because the alternatives  Descarte s demon  brains in vats and controlled simulations  have traditionally been so divorced from the reality we re used to  it is novel to come across a theory that makes me feel okay about my illusory physical world  As with the games I develop  the illusion is kind of the point    Here is Fleming s paper  freely accesible  if you re game   p   ,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/gozsni/why_im_no_longer_a_realist_about_the_physical/
philosophy,2020-05-20 03:24:52,Consent  discourse  and deception   Tom Dougherty seems to imply that in order to consent  you must give up your privacy,gn0vjh,1,8,In his paper  No Way Around Consent   Tom Dougherty takes the stance that any sort of lie or lack of disclosure used to gain consent is deception  which should be considered a form of rape    This seems reasonable  if you are having to lie in order to gain consent  then that consent is not gained by informed measures  If you were sold a car on the promise of it working fine  but it turns out the entire engine was missing  it would be reasonable to assume your consent is void as you would have not purchased that car if you had known the truth   He also takes the stance that their are reasonable forms of concealment  For example  using makeup to appear more attractive to potential partners by concealing blemishes of the skin is not considered undue deception   In  Sex  Lies  and Consent    Dougherty  summarizes his arguments by three points   1  Having sex with someone  while lacking their morally valid consent is seriously wrong  2  Deceiving another person into sex involves having sex with that person  while lacking her morally valid consent  3  Therefore  deceiving someone into sex is seriously wrong   One aspect of consent he focuses on   deal breakers   facts or information that  had they been known by a partner  would have caused that partner to not consent to sex  Should you know something or assume to know that something about yourself is a deal breaker to consent  you are morally obligated to disclose that information     Cheating is a common example when discussing concealment and Dougherty s proposals  If a man where to cheat on his wife and then disclose it to her  it is likely she would not want to get sexual with him  Therefore  to not disclose infidelity  a most probable  deal breaker   is to be considered rape by deception  He even confesses that this may seem revisionary to most people s views on consent  but regards that as still a logical conclusion for how we understand consent  Given his proposals  this does not seem to be a reach   But it also seems to put people on the hook for every thought or desire they have  In short  in order to have proper consent  you have to disclose everything about yourself least they be a deal breaker and turn the encounter into rape   For example  if you have a fetish or kink that you know is generally looked down upon  say  being into step sibling roleplay or be a part of the furry fandom  you likely know that these aspects of yourself would be seen as deal breakers by a large many  Therefore  following Dougherty s line of thinking  not disclosing these private fetishes knowing full well they could be deal breakers is rape by deception   despite the fact that these fetishes are things that most people would not reasonably feel comfortable disclosing   This also would likely have to extend to other private thoughts  If a man were to check out his girlfriend s friend and confess to that  his girlfriend who likely not consent to sex that particular night because of his mental infidelity  So to not disclose that would have to be considered not disclosing a deal breaker  But yet again  it is not unreasonable for someone to not want to disclose sexual feelings towards friends or family of their SO  in part to not wanting to hurt their feelings   If a man were to hookup with a rampant supporter of the Purple Party  despite him being a supporter of their ideological opposite  the Bird Party  it would be reasonable of him to assume that his ideology is a  never would I have sex with a member of the Bird Party in a million years  deal breaker and that his disclosure would make his partner terminate the encounter  So his lack of disclosure should also be rape by deception   If you think a person might not have sex with you if they know something about you  and so you withhold that information and have sex with them  that s rape by fraud  If you lied with intent or did not disclose with intent  it s rape      What this effectively concludes is that to have proper consent  you must give up your privacy  From what he is saying  it must be concluded that private thoughts or beliefs are owed property of your partner in order to ensure consent  regardless of if they feel comfortable disclosing that information or not,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/gn0vjh/consent_discourse_and_deception_tom_dougherty/

philosophy,2020-05-17 14:34:49,Hegel  freedom and social structures,gldxet,10,6,As a metaphysician  theorist of the absolute and philosopher of history  Hegel not only aroused suspicion of authoritarianism  but also hated words of many analytical philosophers  The Hegel renaissance of the last 50 years has therefore been accompanied by a reinterpretation of these terms  But now it makes sense  closer to the original  to take Hegel s philosophy seriously as a food for thought and unusual contribution to the discussion   Hegel provides normative resources that many miss in relativistic and post metaphysical approaches  In addition  the study of Hegel sharpens the view that there are not only equal individuals but also a social structure that has power over actors and distributes unequal positions of power to them    This is what thinkers from Marx to Adorno appreciated about Hegel  his awareness that all human interactions are socially pre structured and that social structures can develop a certain life of their own if they are not consciously controlled  Hegel is by no means the apologist of the whole or absolute  but rather its analyst  who assumes that special people and interactions can never be understood without reference to the social whole  In contrast to what has been accepted as Hegel in the analytical space  the concept of the social whole does not primarily refer to a totality of norms and rules  It is also about the physical and infrastructural side of the social and phenomena such as the market  whose market laws do not correspond to market norms such as  fair exchange  and  adherence to the contract     In his social philosophy Hegel asks  What forms of freedom are possible  And soon adds the conditional  when all interactions are socially structured  Hegel s philosophy of law first analyses types of freedom that are important but deficient because they do not take enough account of social conditionality  namely atomistic and arbitrary consumer decisions and individual freedom of action  And he concludes that the highest degree of freedom is only possible through collective reflection on and intervention in social structures  He formulates this insight particularly with regard to the market  which must be  tamed like a wild animal  by a meeting of the estates in which professional groups coordinate their interests   This conclusion escapes former non metaphysical Hegelians like Pippin and Pinkard  They do not follow Hegel s central step from a theory of action to a social structural analysis  but only look for social conditions of the actors  Hegel s conclusion is only consistent for a thinker who places the absolute or the whole in the foreground of his thinking in his entire system  from logic and natural philosophy to aesthetics    For Hegel  individuals  people  events  animals  determinations  are centrally determined by their position in the structured group or system to which they belong  There may be cases in which this social determination  with the role and identity desired by the individual  falls into one  Hegel optimistically assumes this for the family  But it is clear that a tension can also arise between social role or position and individual self  In such cases  the self reflection and identity that people have developed in these and other circles does not match their social role and position of power   The only solution to this problem is for people to reflect together on the structures of their interaction and negotiate such rules and roles that are as fair to all as possible   At the latest here  Marx separates from Hegel  and non Marxists will also have their justified doubts that finding an optimal social structure for all social groups or such a negotiation and intervention is practicable   But this does not mean that Hegel s philosophy is irrelevant  250 years after his birth  the metaphysical Hegel reminds us that not everything is made up of norms and meanings that change as soon as we change our minds and to which we are only bound if they convince us  Social structures have real power and a certain resistance to our collective views that goes beyond simple habit  And he stresses that social patterns and structures are not as confusing as one might think  There are clear mechanisms that can and should be analysed  criticized and morally judged  In abstracto  Hegel s metaphysics analyses types of structures and their problematic  sometimes even  violent  modes of operation  This helps him to better analyze social structures and thus to judge them   For the metaphysical Hegel the postulate of freedom and equality of all people is quite important as a legal principle and basis of private and public law  But it can by no means solve the problem of human freedom alone  In order to understand the problem of freedom properly  one must admit that social structures exist and therefore structural inequalities  unequal degrees of freedom  participation and material advantages  which are neither chosen by individuals nor are they inherent  In addition to the principles of justice  it is this structure that makes a society more just or less just  depending on whether it maximizes the freedom and social participation of many or few   A central criterion for assessing a society is therefore  according to Hegel  the breadth and depth of social co determination  in the sense that as many social groups as possible can defend their real interests as concretely as possible  and thus participate in the material and other advantages of their society  A comparative study of Rawls would be interesting here  especially with regard to his concept of predistribution  an institution of society that fights social inequality ex ante rather than ex post,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/gldxet/hegel_freedom_and_social_structures/
